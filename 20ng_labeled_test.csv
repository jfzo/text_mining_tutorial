'I guess Im still not clear on what the term "candida bloom" means, but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use. This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the "quack" diagnosis that has been being discussed.    Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, Ive mentioned to a  number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.   Again, this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed. There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea, but I dont think anyone would view this as a quack therapy.';2

'The following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as "de Sacramentis", usually attributed to St. Ambrose of Milan, and the canon of the traditional Catholic Mass of the Roman rite.  The conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the traditional Roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime in the late 4th century.  Taken from "The Mass of the Western Rites", by the Right Reverend Dom Fernand Cabrol, Abbot of Farnborough, 1934, without permission.

'> When Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words: "Blessed art thou  > among women" (Luke 1:42), it appears that this places Mary  > beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.  But Deborah says (Judges 5:24):   > Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite,  > Blessed above all women in the tents.  It can doubtless be taken that Jaels slaying of Sisera was a type of Marys victory over sin. But even if we take Deborahs words as applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be applicable literally to Jael.  We may well take them to mean that God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His people, and that she has this in common with Mary.  But we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she was sinless.';3

'[This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan].  predicitions if you have some many types of happen again may predict reaction  There are several problems here. First, you are discussing only experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense.  Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. The observation of a fossil is repeatable, since any qualified observer may look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also, there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.  Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles, rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).  So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the necessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the original event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.

'I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).  Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.  This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.  	Graeme Gill.  ########################################################################### "A note on gamma correction and images"  Author: Graeme W. Gill         graeme@labtam.oz.au  Date: 93/5/16   "What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?" --------------------------------------  Although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image", there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If youve ever downloaded images from BBS or the net, youve probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some look too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction (or the lack of it).  Why do we need gamma correction at all ? --------------------------------------  Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-corrected image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesnt_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this:  Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma  So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct" the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get what you want. So you have to do this to your image:  gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)  For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.  If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ? -----------------------------------------------------  The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are  rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those images with a program that doesnt do gamma correction, then it will look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT.  Whose fault is all this ? -----------------------  It is really three things. One is all those display programs out there that dont do gamma correction properly. Another is that most image formats dont specify a standard gamma, or dont have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying gammas.  At least two file formats do the right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).  Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has, and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.  [ Note that xv 2.21 doesnt provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls doesnt do the right thing, as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image. ]  How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ? ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.)  If your viewer doesnt do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness will be above the center.  If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be around 2.2   [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag, and once youve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile]  How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? -------------------------------------------------  This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other.  If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.  If your viewer doesnt do gamma correction, then linear images will look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.  Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing -----------------------------------------------------  One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. This means images  could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance), if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level.  If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma, and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.  (I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).';1

'The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the publics perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.  ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission]   "Theres no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salaries"  By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services        On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors earnings  is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.      It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called  Families USA.       The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe  that doctors make too much money.      The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for  physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be  OK.      How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.      Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment  and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign  and are still simmering.      You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that  earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority  of Americans dont make those bucks,  they assume that those  who  do are stealing it from them.      Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but dont  kid  yourself.   Karl Marx lives.      Its also stupid because it didnt ask key  questions,  such  as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to  become a physician?      If those polled said no,  they didnt know, then they should  have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they  should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much  a doctor should earn if they dont know what it takes to become a  doctor?      Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "How  much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent  grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order  to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking  courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and  maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years  of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth  years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and  (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)  put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,  depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in  debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60  hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or  more until they retire or fall over?"      As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably  more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and  Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have  called together to remake Americas health care.      Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far  more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,  social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is  to health what Clintons first budget is to frugality.      But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,  many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the  major cause of high medical costs.      Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.   Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for  our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in  a McDonalds?      And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become  a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch  cabbages.      Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or  Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But  instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,       "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest  problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,  you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you  guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;  getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the  microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into  the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot  victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease  while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.      "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single  biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is  amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.      "In fact,  I dont understand how they can stand looking  at  your blubbery bods all day.      "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and  start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do."      But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,  there is another solution: Dont use them.      Thats right.   You dont feel well?   Then try one of those  spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands  upon your head and declare you fit.      Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest  pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit  there, and pop in a couple of valves.      Youre  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that  overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house  than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and  malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?      Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.   And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on  how to give it its shots.      By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much  pollsters should earn?

'Before you finalize your file in the FAQs (or after), you might want to  correct the typo in the following:   It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with  "homosexual".  As a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work  entering human life as a result of sin.     Before the fall (Gen 2:15) "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into  the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." which I would call "work".   For me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added  at the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the  work for sustenance).  In a way, some view "work" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes  is a fun book! - for melancholies).  I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.  Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what  you state as your purpose "It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian  homosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.  I wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific  homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).   Perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or  refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid  heterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it  was worth"?';3

'Yes.  Heres what you should do.  Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay, but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it, so you dont have to transform any vertex more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys dont have to be transformed at all.  Whenever you transform a vertex, check if its on the far side of the hither plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.  Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage.';1

'-*----  I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances, both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or caregivers, at worst.   As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions you make for your child, it will have far less importance than many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents think about only a little.   This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a momentous medical decision.  It is not.';2

If one takes the translation of "this book" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere 	around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely 	holding something that is in violation of this command.  	It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones 	(they didnt like to date their letters, I guess).

'...  There are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would cause a hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid, mainly thyroxin). Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesnt sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesnt have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have Hashimotos thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear. The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels. Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness, and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart), changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.  I am not a doctor, so Im sure I mistated something, but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they arent corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain things in detail to you and your wife.';2

Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing for Alzheimers disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.    In addition to Alzheimers disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease.    "Weve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding, "this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimers earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain."    Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimers showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.    Current drug therapy for Alzheimers disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimers is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimers were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.    "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimers from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine," said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study.    Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers MRI units soon.

Q & A on Alzheimers Disease:     What is Alzheimers disease and how is it caused?    Alzheimers disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.    How many people does it affect?    Alzheimers disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimers debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.    What are its signs and symptoms?    Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness" caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and suggests the following criteria:     -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is       normal.    -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.    -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.    -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.     Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia.  -30-';2
'When I need a kick-butt God, or when I need assurance of the reality of truth, I pray to God the Father.  When I need a friend, someone to put his arm around me and cry with me, I pray to Jesus.  When I need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation, I pray for the Holy Spirit.  I realize that the above will probably make some people cringe, but what can I say? I think the doctrine of the trinity is an attempt to reconcile Jesus being God and being distinct from God, as described in the Bible.  I wonder if Jesus had been a Hindu how different the wording would be.';3
'Dear Netters:  Maybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience  a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which  can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one  experiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is not  enjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme  fatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts  that long, it makes me sweatening.  Initially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt that  the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.  So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique.   Thanks.';2

'I dont think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not. Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ, which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christs cricumcision which we, in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.  Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism, which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.  Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience.  Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.    Do you teach a child to pray the Lords prayer? Do you expect them to not steal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the new covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11.   But also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam, *IF* thats what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?     >  Ezekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God, in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of God puting them into his new order, and not a question of"personal" faith as such.   But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal death, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death, because adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death.    While this psalm is figurative in its language, it is not hyperbolic, and the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is  what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt offering, etc) Davids sin with bathsheba included this element, as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have.   But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was  passed generationally. Thats why the organ of generation had to be cut. Thats why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in baptism today.';3

I intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this statement.  I intend to also show that such a declaration can be  made without there being a religious justification for morality, in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist.  Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side, i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral, or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do so.  I think there are a lot of people who dont believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it.  This should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other peoples and see where their ideas are standing.

'Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the churchs history. It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the  deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the church, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage, and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD).   "At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to the extent of the canon, or the number of the books which should be acknowledged as divine and authoritative.     The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally  received, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version of the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books suitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class between canonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings. And justly; for those books, while they have great historical value, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New, all originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannot be therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever cited by Christ or the aposteles."  "In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed at the end of the fourth century through the authority of Jerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the principle of tradition), and more especially of Augustine, who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint, and the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic Epistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in some places, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha as *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority."  This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the Council of Hippo and of Carthage.  It is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to the fourth session of the Council of Trent.  The footnote  lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical  books, but then says "The Tridentine list or decree was the first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration on the Canon of the Holy Scriptures."  Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not official until Trent.  Thus my previous erroneous statement was not entirely groundless.  It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent went on to uphold "the old Latin Vulgate Edition" of  the Scriptures as authentic.  Which, I would suppose,  todays Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said. Also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical and canonical books--in contrast to (Eerdmans statement of) the fourth century views.';3

'Please help.  I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.

The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.  I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc., all to no avail.

'Hi everyone,  Im trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I cant hear God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me, and I feel that I cant possibly get to know him until he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just dont know or understand how to listen.  Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover. This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening, but I have a few questions.  1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, "OK God, her you go, Im committing my life to you", I wouldnt really feel that hed listened - at least, I couldnt be sure that he had. So how does one (or how did you) commit oneself to God?  2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that Im as good as many Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of loving your neighbour - I dont go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what do I have to give up?  3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if any) burdens am I taking on?  4) So then, whats the general difference before and after? I assume, that (like on your birthday you dont suddenly feel a year older) it wont suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?  5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find out what the it in the last sentence actually _is_?!

Dont tell me you dont worship Osiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinsons Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British Masonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black mason.  Ive talked with him, though much he likes to hide ("mystery").  Special handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to "evangelize" me, he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a "mystery" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest degree mason every learns of. I havent read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired apologist (cant remember his name) on TV, didnt exactly come to this same conclusion.    "Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mothers arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, the son, the husband of his mother, was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the Masonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man.  He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, The God of Fortification.  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally celebrated as the strong chief of the buildings.  THis strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall characteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that Osiris was black......."  Hislop  It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately repented from mysteries of the lodge!)  Nimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue."  It is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or should I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spotted cow".  Ill stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to be a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesnt find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?';3

They are far more likely to think that they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter. That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This doesnt have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look at Abraham Lincolns second inaugural speech. The relevant section is below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both prophesies posted here.  --- Excerpt from Abraham Lincolns 2nd Inaugural speech----  Both read the same Bible, and pray  to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem  strange that any men should dare to ask a just Gods assistance in wringing  their bread from the sweat of other mens faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh" If we shall suppose that American  Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come but which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe  to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty  scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue,  until all the wealth piled by the bond-mans two hundred and fifty years of  unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with  the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three  thousand  years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord,  are true and righteous altogether"   With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right,  as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we  are in; to bind up the nations wounds; to care for him who shall have  borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which  may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves,  and with all nations.   --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---';3

'Wow! You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously "socially unacceptable" yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as "guilt" and  "morality".  Ive heard it said (and fully believe) that if it werent for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be  absolutely impossible.  Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to  attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it aint  illegal, then dont pick on me).  Im not saying this is wrong, merely  that it is a byproduct of a society which has:  	1) A high education level, 	2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media, 	3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and 	4) A "me" oriented culture.  I guess what Im saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition,  here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\ cant allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we  are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  those freedoms dont impinge on anothers.  IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we  appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old  territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized,  inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the  continued destabilization of society.    I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this  mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms  in order to "stabilize" society.  Yet I believe development of societies  follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a  social model which maximizes indiv. freed.s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is  possible to live with a "non-stable" society?  Anybody see a way out?  Comments?  PS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We dont.  Do we want to?    Phil Trodwell';0
'Note that "scientific evidence" in this area does not prove any conclusions. There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexuals brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little.  Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the "scientific evidence" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain genetic problems.  Even if they did have scientific evidence, I doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy  Spirit that these things are sinful.  This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  He said  something very true.  Christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination.  Most people do give in to their leanings. In Christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh, and bringing it into submission.  One person may have a problem with his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  But God offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers.   The preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates with him.  Is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband? The Bible is concerned with human morality, and only touches on animal morality as it relates to humans.';3

'How is it that placebos are legal?  It would seem to me that if, as a patient, you purchase a drug youve been prescribed and its just sugar (or whatever), theres a few legal complications that arise:  	1.  If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you arent given accepted treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice.  	2. A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)  	3. Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive "bait and switch" to an extreme...).

'No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  Im rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in the accepted academic/scientific journals.

'Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research that there is.  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of a unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the  procedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school. It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use the reasoning that they will "look like Daddy" and like their friends as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male, although a major surgical procedure exists.  As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any problems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water.

'The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other new technology for hearing aids.  The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new programmable aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in noisy situations.  The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness.  This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff).  Aids with simple compressors dont descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations.';2

'OFM Comments:   No disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on. But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  Thats quite different from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesnt sound like the usual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he does. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of  Lazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that a fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice and isnt Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good  reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal  hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between  God and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built on Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were removed, there would BE no foundation.    Thats basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians  that DONT have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God.

'From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)  1] An english translation of this can be found in:    "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an    introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson    (London, 1923).  2] Another work that might be useful is:    "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and    Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;    reprinted 1970).  (This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I dont know if it actually contains an english translation or not.)  3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:    "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in    Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).  4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early 80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyones interested.)  5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if youre interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:    "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible    Society, 1971).  Metzgers book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).     "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full    report (with an English translation) of the several additions and    other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...    Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the    text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the    evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).   6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).  7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clarks edition (mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.  8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.  9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.';3

'You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment. (You are given a small bottle of antigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) My allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatment process I had to return to the doctors office every month for re-testing and a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralized a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual drops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost is less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.';2

Dan Jacobson  danj@welchgate.welch.jhu.edu  -----  Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a client/server protocol for making a world wide information service, with many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher,  comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.  The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or via anonymous ftp:  rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq  Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body to find out how to do FTP by e-mail.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:  Q0:  What is Gopher? Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software? Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher? Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher? Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software? Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? Q7: What is veronica? Q8: What is Available for Biology? ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q0:  What is Gopher?  A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed      information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide      information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While      providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher      facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers      throughout the world.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?  A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory      /pub/gopher  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?  A2:  You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC      or workstation       There are clients for the following systems.  The directory      following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous      ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory      /pub/gopher.

Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client      itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:         Type=1        Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu        Port=70        Path=        Name=Gopher Software Distribution.         Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and      look in the gopher directory.        There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.      The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine      "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more      information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client      software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A      client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,      scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to      in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?  A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize      network lag.       Telnet Public Logins:       Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area      ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------      consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America      gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America      panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America      gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe      info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia      gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden      tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America      ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador      gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan        It is recommended that you run the client software instead of      logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the      custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)      and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file      to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?  A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University      of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help      our campus find answers to their computer questions.         It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information      System used by a large number of sites in the world.       Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to      count.        The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:           Internet Gopher Developers       100 Union St. SE #190       Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA       Or via FAX at:         +1 (612) 625-6817  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?  A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.      As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:               - Search local WAIS indices.        - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?  A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :       _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, OReilly, 1992 (Editors note:                              ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)       _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNets Guide to Our World Online"      By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to       Computerized Archives.       veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles      in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica       is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher      items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.      Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy      to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the      gopher protocol.       To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on       Minnesotas gopher server, or point your gopher at:       Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)       Type=1       Port=70       Path=1/veronica       Host=futique.scs.unr.edu  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q8: What is Available for Biology?

'As per various threads on science and creationism, Ive started dabbling into a book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question that I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not  necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific  fact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if Im being vague.  The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there  explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?

'Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I cant believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.   I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine ones belief critically.  Ill tell you something I left out of my testimony I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works, thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.   I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.  As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the students workload considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first attempt. However, I think Ill never forget the lesson:   No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X, it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent.  But it can still be wrong.   I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear,  filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god playing any part.    Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance, the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.  Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.   This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind, and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the evidence.   It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.   A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible again.   I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think Im lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I cant go on lying to myself.  Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me, shell know what to do. Im willing. I just dont know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence, it looks like she doesnt.   Petri';0

'The first and only thing Ive ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines (not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, youre going the wrong way".  	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool.  	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight, clean, and well imaged; you dont always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case.  	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods.';1
'[ Deletia; in case anybody hadnt noticed, Frank and I are debating   "objective morality", and seemingly hitting semantics. ]         It may be that, being a non-native English-speaker, Ive misunderstood your usage of "objective", and tried to debate something you dont assert; my apologies. Im at a loss to imagine what you really do mean, though.         Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanitys sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can have.        Im saying the Universe has a "real age", because I see evidence for it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of peoples opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results.         I cant see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be the same.         Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests (which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we conducted said tests in identical manner, no? They dont, which I take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.         Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean physical pain. You have a sharp point, Ill give you that; but you still havent given me a way to quantify morality.         We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no "ultimate hypothesis of morality" towards which these changes could gravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable, producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.         "Better" and "worse" are (almost?) always defined in the context of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within* *that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of "good" and "bad"; I wish you luck.         Isnt that what _youre_ doing, when assuming an "objectively real" morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my statement?         Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was "objective", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir incorrect morality seems to function fine. How come?        As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick them from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).  [ deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]         One thing is "good" under some circumstances, because we wish to achieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something else, and that thing is no longer so clearly "good" at all.        Some things are hard to make "good", because wed seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still, the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.        I almost always know what "good" means; sometimes I even know why. I never claim this "good" is thereby fixed in stone, immutable.  [...]        Yes, me too, and Ive tried a thing or two down that line; it doesnt look good for objective values to me at all.';0

'Whats sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendors hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple, DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendors hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced thats faster and cheaper than the one they just bought.

'The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News.  I guess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this church.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately, this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is perceived to approach.  There is a real element of disparation in this make it happen at any cost style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into this equation?  Baptisms draw parents ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs told theyd be killed by bee stings if they didnt submit to religious rite.  By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau  Colorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a Baptist minister.  Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by their parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the Cornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight, free balloons, squirt guns and candy.  Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or their families are not of the Baptist faith.  The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including Paulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent.  My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel thats a false pretense, said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized.  Cornerstone church officials defended their actions.  We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded us to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized, said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church.  Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because they didnt ask, Irwin said.  Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their childrens friends who were members of the Cornerstone Church.  Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.  ------------------------------------------- Arent these the same behaviors we condemn in the Hari Krishnas and other cults?  [I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions.  First, Im not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of the clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents consent, I might be willing to do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant much careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobodys consent.  Whether you believe in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a Christian community.  If there isnt a commitment from *somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of the Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is likely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from a baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already has been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he get rebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, hes being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.';3

'This idea, that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the Bible to the people in their own language, is a myth.  Many vernacular translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation.  The Vulgate Bible, which is still the official version of the Bible for the Catholic Church, was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar == vulgate) tongue of its day, Latin, and had existed for about a millenium before the Reformation.     It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented until the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred.';3

'I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  There  is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the groin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did the honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived happily ever after.   Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Raus classes was the time he would come into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about 3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, "Boys, do you know what this is?  Its a medical instrument called a cock reamer and its used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there without an anesthetic!"  Needless to say this had a chilling effect. I didnt have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in life as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible urethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinking that I might one day see, "Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) ."         ]';2

I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in assembly, which I dont know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?  	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will tell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.  	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books, I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios.

'I quote from the journal, "30 Days In the Church and In the World," 1992, No. 8/9, p. 29.   Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:  	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise 	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot 	cause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of  	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties, 	including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar 	reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede 	aggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Churchs  	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will  	continue to be expressed in the  	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the 	effective means for preserving public order and personal 	safety.  To the degree that means other than the death 	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the 	peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred 	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the 	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.    As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Churchs teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.     I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question of faith or morals arises.';3

There  will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didnt quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well.   I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close  to being it. Hope to find one soon.    I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of  the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.   I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what is "scientist".

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone  progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection.  The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is  released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent  effective.  "This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent  pregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable,  given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to  missing a daily dose."  Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and  clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive  protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the  injections.  As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and  risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional  before making a decision to use it.  Depo Proveras effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive  studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies  in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo  Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.  The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In  addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain,  dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have  acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood  clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.  The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the  drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this  potential effect.  Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for  contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich.,  which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive  Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s.  At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause  breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer,  including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.

"These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious  illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would  otherwise be possible," said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. "The effort  to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and  indeed a hallmark of this administration."   These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to  approve a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when the  drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such  endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in  themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified  scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.   Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval  earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or  prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used.   The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and  effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established.  The drugs sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct  postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drugs effect on the surrogate  endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.   One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a  model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the  cause of AIDS.   Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that  a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used  safely only under a restricted distribution plan.   "The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process  without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDA  commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "While drug approval will be accomplished  faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and  effectiveness standards required by law."

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that  certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can  prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The  degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of  visual impairment       This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of  the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose  their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug  treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million  Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and  100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease  that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo  surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.       The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa)  Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye  Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas  Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge  Yancoooulos, Regenerons Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an  exclusive license for this research from UCSF.      In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to  assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring  substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week.  Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their  photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light  exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic  Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing  unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and  Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.       Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regenerons Director of  Clinical Research, said, "BDNFs ability to rescue neurons in the retina that  have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment,  and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF  could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached  surgically."       "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the  retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases  to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope  that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression  and preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D.,  Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.       In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in  conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for  peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy,  motor neuron diseases, Parkinsons disease, and Alzheimers disease. By  itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease).       Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a  leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for  the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve  injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and  Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

These findings, according to  investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have  serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing  countries.       "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and  have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the  importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body  weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing  countries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr.  William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid  metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.       Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the  food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while  simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.   These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra  Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have  coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary  heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is  virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name  Tarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on  "kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more  while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.      The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas,  and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water,  together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras  also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains  approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69  percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator  in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while  low in cholesterol and fat.      The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL,  low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density  lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values  are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated  cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the  Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although  able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol.       Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria  Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school  building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food  was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the  investigators direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food  stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly,  and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for  cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements  included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.   Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were  fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet.       "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40  percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that  many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in  fiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in  the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian  Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number that  incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in  the diet.  CSI indicates the diets potential to elevate the cholesterol  level, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet  averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connors "affluent" diet used in the study  ranks a CSI of 149.       The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of  establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before  exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating  dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or  plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat  and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "You  must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put  into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not  discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease  because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on  a plateau," Dr. Connor says.       After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects mean plasma  cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL  fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent,  and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride  levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in  weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon,  yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35  days.   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993       The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized  nations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount  of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic  study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary  cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.   In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total  calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects  the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary  cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased  quite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains.      Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of  coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of  fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because  of their usual high fat intake.       Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20  percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI  around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in  meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent  suggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The original  Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of  fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of  meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to  olive oil is not going to help the situation."       The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the  emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies  undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart  disease starts with a given societys elite, who typically eat a different  diet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, the  entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,  which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the  developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can  concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public  health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for  unnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says.      "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move  their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a  very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary  heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years  ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludes.

'I dont think Ive changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one.  I didnt say what would be considered cruel, only that a painless death wasnt.  Now, cruelty must involve some sort of suffering, I believe.  I dont think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but its over so quickly...   Pardon?   No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isnt cruel, but I dont think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.   Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  Id say that any pain that lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).';0

'[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]  R. Scroggs       Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a "Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology."  The term is derived from Lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male").   Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid "contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks (108).       Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part, thus differing from Boswells "learned discussion" (107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with a male" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9), which Scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is the active partner "who keeps the malakos of the mistress or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he affirms (109).      This is Scroggs interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The combination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slave dealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave dealers [who procure them]" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of pederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121).  Even "serious minded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1.  Consequently Paul "Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122). We cannot know what Paul would have said about the "contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122).       In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item in the lists" (104).        Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a "catalogue of vices,"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are "irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129).  The "model in todays Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT" that "Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to todays debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination. . . " (127).        REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI  D. Wright       In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswells view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswells treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the "Apostolic Constitutions,"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28).  Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswells claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps with a male," making arseno- the object.       Wright also faults Boswells claims regarding linguistic features of the term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: "No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its object and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its gender" (132).        It is with Boswells treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources.  For example, Aristides Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis, androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswells discussion.  Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34).        Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia ("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as "You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commit adultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality with boys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43).       Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).       Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.       Wright next replies to Boswells contention that the term would not be absent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g. Didache) show no acquaintance with Pauls letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41).        Boswells treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wrights attention (141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom, omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostoms infrequent use of the term.  Wright observes that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world.        Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning "homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswells limited conclusion based on them.       Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke "generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).       In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and others who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies.';3

'-Allergy medicine, huh?  Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an antihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up and eat something youre allergic to (even if they wont test you to tell you what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms, then fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because Id been throwing up for four solid days and couldnt even drink water - but I got taken off it again when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what the side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it prescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am allergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I cant eat have nothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isnt really an option; there are too many permutations.';2

To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?   Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would be irrational.  Which is it?  The first part of the second statement contains no information, because you dont say what "the beliefs" are.  If "the beliefs" are strong theism  and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it.   I cant agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which I suspect you do not have.   I dont understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?';0

'Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a  dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems. In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual fantasies. I have deliberately done things that I would never do in real life. I understand the need to control ones thoughts, but I always felt that dreams were format free, no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes I would  have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)  Is this an incorrect attitude? Rather than weakening my inhibitions, I could argue that I got certain things "out of my system" by  experiencing them in dreams. By analyzing a dream I can determine if I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not.  I cant believe that other people dont do the same. It seems  silly to attach moral significance to dreams.  I think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences, which I have never had.  Contradictions welcome.';3

'From: dhammers@pacific.? (David Hammerslag)  	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with  	Christs statement that in the resurrection people will neither  	marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?  Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit. Tobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called  "The Apocrypha". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews  of Christs day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the son of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had  entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers  all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.  Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was her only relative and "...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning" (6:17).  Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The  seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not  eliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting  story to read. Its kind of a mythical romance. Its a little shorter  than Esther.  The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most  notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16.  	"Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry  	her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as 	he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage 	are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of  	the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they  	are out of the world.  	"Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor  	are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which 	angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are  	worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of  	glory."';3
'This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die).  However Jesus was referring to John the Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John (remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to Elijah.  John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom.  The verses that describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about Elijah.  Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering Servant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.

'I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.  Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound.  Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldnt compare them head to head with the Widex. Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.  The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the difference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that arent quite so expensive.';2

'Dave - you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle "God Wants You Rich & Other Enticing Doctrines", which discusses OOBEs in one of her chapters.  In the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit (eg Ezekiel, Paul). I believe that also this experience is counterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to leave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book in Los Angeles airport entitled "Easy Journeys to Other Planets" which uses such techniques.  The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body departure - the book "The Challanging Counterfeit", about a former medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last trance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him while returning to his body at the end of the seance because of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally protected by the Lord.  There may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the phenomena of tripping.  As regards the connection between body and soul, there is an interesting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about old age, the preacher writes "Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the silver cord is severed." (12.5-6) My understanding of this silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an astronauts air-line to his spaceship. When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches the soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken: astral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports a case of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his apartment, with no apparent external cause.';3

'I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in  support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become  curious about it.  I dont want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only  heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn  on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop.  I would be interested in knowing more about these things.   The first one claimed that the word "church" was derived from the Greek  "cyclos", and that it was therefore related to the worship of "Circe".  I dont know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to  be based on false etymology.  The second claimed an etymological relationship between "Ishtar" and  "Easter", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some  of the wilder notions of the British Israelites.  Regarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, "Easter" is  derived from the old English name for April - "Eosturmonath". The Venerable  Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called "Eostre", but  apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more  about her. It also seems that the term "Easter" is only used by the English  and those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term  "Ostern", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries.  So I would be interested in any evidence of "Easter" being used for Pascha  by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo- Saxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those  who appear to derive the theory from Hislop.';3

'I would put it stronger than that.  I consider it nonsense.  Simply put, I do not see any way that a "Platonic essence" could have any *real* existance.  "Essence" in the Platonic sense does not have any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways.  So, to attribute an essence to God is to attribute to him something that does not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant essence, thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.  Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.  --  sarima@teradata.com			(formerly tdatirv!sarima)   or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com';3

I cant see what you are objecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs would agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot?  You really ought to say what you mean by "belief in Jesus Christ". It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a Christian. Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God. But followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that Jesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of other historical and mythical figures.

If people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects.  The more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice.

'Claude, Ive not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A( retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by  high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).

'There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another figure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99% that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior. How many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many people have lied or sinned in other ways?   Why isnt it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes "men with men working that which is unseemly" to describe the acts.   Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of  mans not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their acts were shameless.   Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways.    I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.   If the Law is reflection of Gods character and true holy nature, then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.   If homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome,  endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime!    Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at I Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his fathers wife.  There is a prohibition against having your fathers wife in  Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having ones fathers wife.    Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan  coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact taking ones fathers wife wasnt even done among the Gentiles.  It was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not.   One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. God is greater than all of it.   Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many  people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not Gods willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that uses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin.   I dont see how you come to that conclusion.  Pauls dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols. Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others.    But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough.  Paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof."  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.  Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.   Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Pauls approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should  sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual "marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered  a more damaging sin.   Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.   Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. After he fell he would have to toil over the ground.   That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else.   Im sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this  conclusion.  Its like saying, "How should I kill myself, with gun or aresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?    In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with  physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all  leads to spiritual death.   The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act.  Second, isnt it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having "loving relationships?"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love."

'[ . . .]  I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of "right" and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true, veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply cant be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness" of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold different moral values (feelings).';0

'(This is a continuation of an earlier post)   (I am sorry you found this offensive.  It was not my intent to offend.  I was  leading up to another point, which I discuss in more detail below.)   I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for  homosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of  bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask  this gently:  why are you so judgemental of other peoples sexual preferences?   What happened to "No doubt I am free to do anything"?  I think you have a  serious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between  homosexuality and bestiality as "slimey" and "sleazy", you are making an  implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting,  unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about  homosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any  sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even  have their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them  all of being mere "jokers"?  I notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only  Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical  prohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament  passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none  that condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian  homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any "clear" New Testament  statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian  zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament  makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?  I am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically  acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply  the same standards to everyone elses declared sexual preferences as well.  If  the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual  preferences as well, Im going to apply them and see what comes up.  Im not  trying to "torpedo a serious issue" by using what you label "a ridiculous  joke".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines  for Christian sexuality, and I dont think such a question is "irrelevant" in a  group called "soc.religion.christian".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and  bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good  precedent for doing the same.   I dont know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a  side issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging  people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine  whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New  Testament that "God has joined together" heterosexual couples, and that the  marriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual  intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under  the Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards  of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the  sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I dont think its  right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to  Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesnt.   That was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different  examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong  to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians.    It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally dont  get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual  orientation; Im afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar  attitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with  child abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of "clear" NT  condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation  (or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on  alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.   This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere  rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the  answer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you  yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find  bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in  connection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply  all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply  them to homosexuals?  Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at  the thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of  homosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially  unacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.   Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual  morality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible  condemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality  than it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality  with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer  this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many  people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.  Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely  pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that  the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think  adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love  my neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and  unmentionable, are you disobeying "repeated orders not to judge or condemn  others"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you  and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same  offense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible  brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?   Im not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus  is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I  agree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our  salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us,  and we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christs grace mean that those  who refer to sin as "sin" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking  in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible  calls something "sin", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it  sin too.  As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on  Christian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible  says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every  verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and "unclear" at best.   The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some  dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as  condemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most  positive thing you can say about the Bibles treatment of homosexuality is that  some verses fail to clearly condemn it.  Thats it.  Jesus declared all foods  clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to  keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from  being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian  practice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination  that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you  have some verses which are at best "not clear" but which some people believe  *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and thats the sum  total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.  I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything  simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and  those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your  case as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I dont believe it says  anything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving  one another, and not judging one another, but thats not really the issue, is  it?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for  Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.   Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.   Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still  left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about  homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who  are under the law and those who are not.  - Mark';3
'Consider special relativity.  It hasnt be proved, nor has it been disproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people are interested in it!   Ive satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that could be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).   For example, if a loud ``godlike voice vociferously announced, ``I am God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity, and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist) would say, ``Boy, we sure didnt understand gravity as well as we thought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we didnt understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.   Im sure glad you dont know where I live, since you dont seem to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices in your head, and Gods voice.   You seem to have missed my point.

'Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics  that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few  important parameters.  The polygons are all convex.  They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)  I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons.  This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.  The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small  number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.  Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons.     It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms. If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a  asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.';1

'Welcome.   Hm. I get a little queasy around the phrase "arent morally  responsible", perhaps because Ive heard it misused so many times. (I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general, most folk cant control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day and think about has some impact on them, hm? And Im not sure what "actions" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant about the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as our actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally responsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important part of that.  I dont know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. Ive had dreams, some fairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably much better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that, than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by dreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.  What on Earth is your definition of "often"? I know exactly one case of two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could see why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only "other plane" I know of is the spiritual realm. I dont think *anyones* dreams, perhaps outside the occasional prophets, represent actual actions on an alternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then yes they would have direct moral significance.  in a different environment, then different moral laws apply" is my guess of what you said.] I dont see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones "environment" changes the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian wont it *always* come down to "what Jesus would have us do?"  Truth? I dont claim to be an expert in dreams. Ill note that the Bible doesnt talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak to us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it warns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.';3

'I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues,  however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require "incredibly  perverse interpretations" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.  "... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers,  nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards,  nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were  some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11.  Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this apply to homosexuals?  I understand "fornication" to be sex outside of marriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing as same-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been that the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence to the contrary.  "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion."  Lev. 18:22-23.  I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I know of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention, intercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a perversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be a Christian zoophile?  By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow "people of alternative orientations".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible with an attitude of "what is the Bible trying to say" and not "what do I WANT the Bible to say."  I choose not to give in to my "perverted" sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I like it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times, and I have had days where it really got me down, but I dont blame God for this, I blame the sin itself.  - Mark  [Theres some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that "homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesnt meant that I think all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the evidence is such that you cant just quote one verse and solve things.  I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why is homosexuality wrong?  Because its fornication.  Why is it fornication?  Because theyre not married.  Why arent they married? Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality is wrong.  In order to break the circle theres got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong.';3

'Sorry about the delay in responding, due to conference paper deadline panic.   [Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]   That ("complicated") isnt in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; its more the other way around. Its from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG)  where G is the complement of G  and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG) >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense, HG is necessarily more "complicated" than H for any H and G, so I may be splitting hairs, but what Im trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG) holds, with equality if and only if P(HG) = 0.   Well, "P(x | A) = P(x | B)" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):    P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>      P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)  where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).  So A and B are "equally consistent with the data" in that observing x doesnt give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.  In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we dont know the actual values, and its this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG.   Thats certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or not a `divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word.  Now it seems to me, as Ive said, that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather *less* well if one proposes a `divine component in addition, since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isnt even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission, G is `divine component, x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.   Not that Im a statistician as such either, but:  The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the (read `my) observations to date. However, theism (of the type with which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways.  This means that these regions of the space of possible observations,  which I loosely termed "appearances of god/s", have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.  Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism expends on making "appearances of god/s" possible must come from somewhere else (i.e. other possible observations).  All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isnt* an "appearance of god/s" must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.  Sorry if thats still a bit jargonesque, but its rather difficult to put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total area under them is always unity.  An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is "the coin is fair", and that B is "the coin is unfair (two-headed)". (Ive used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)  Then    P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1   P(T | A) = 0.5  }    P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1   P(T | B) = 0    }  The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they dont actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads.  Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are modified according to                              P(H | A)   e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                               P(H)  and                              P(H | B)   e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                               P(H)  Now we dont know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed.  Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have                   n   e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)  and                     n   e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),  and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.  The loose analogy is between "unfair coin" and atheism, and between "fair coin" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which would falsify "unfair coin", is analogous to an "appearance of god/s", which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle is the same.    Quite so, but this type of theism is what I might call "the G in the HG", in terms of our Ockhams Razor discussion, and Id bin it on those grounds.   The hypotheses dont have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model, the theism isnt falsifiable.    You dont have to. We dont need, in the above analogy, to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity. You dont need to know the initial values of the running estimates either. Its clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin) approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.  All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible under Ha, and all else is equal.   Any observations you like; it really doesnt matter, nor affect the reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which would count as "appearances of god/s". Examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of revelation.    OK, well downgrade "*does* interact" to "*may* interact", which would actually be better since "does interact" implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced.   Ill explain, but bear in mind that this isnt central; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction "Appearances of god/s will never happen", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesnt make this prediction either, the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition.)  Predictions include such statements as "Prayer is efficacious" (implying "If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious"), or "Prayer is *not* efficacious", or "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled." I dont think we have any problems of misunderstanding here.    Thats fine; I dont claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.     I think you are; an "appearance of god/s" is sufficient to falsify atheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.   No: by way of a counterexample, let X = "the coin is fair", or more accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) "the two sides of the coin are different". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable, and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.     Oops. Sorry. Mea culpa.   We agree here.   "The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992." Said Rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure to happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it.  "No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its explanation will ever be observed." That about sums the whole thing up.   Cheers  Simon';0
'Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know   Christian homosexuals before judging them.  I maintain that I was not   judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong.

'From article <1993May1.092058.1@aurora.alaska.edu>, by pstlb@aurora.alaska.edu:   Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is what AI students do when theyre really supposed to be doing something else, e.g. thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors pet programs to run properly, etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it. Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.  In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs. At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should Get back to the keyboard and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say Im inclined to agree.  (I dont claim to be a superhacker, but I dont think that invalidates my remarks. And Im sure this isnt the whole story.)';1
'FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY                        by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist                           Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody "knew" that a            heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would            violate the "laws" of physics.  All of the "experts" and            "authorities" said so.                            For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  "The            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of            force, can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be."                            Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright            Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final            word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they            crash).                            Today, orthodox physicists and other "scientists" are            saying similar things against several kinds of Free Energy            Technologies, using negative terms such as "pseudo-science"            and "perpetual motion", and citing so-called "laws" which            assert that "energy cannot be created or destroyed" ("1st law            of thermodynamics") and "there is always a decrease in useful            energy" ("2nd law of thermodynamics").  The physicists do not            know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare            that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF            IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern "science" and help to            cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox            modern theories.                            Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-           OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT            SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated            pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment.                            Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy,            but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by            various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices,            they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they            can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy            has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and            often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly            designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                            For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058,            #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for            motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earths magnetic            field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to            be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in            "Science & Mechanics" magazine, Spring 1980, ("Amazing            Magnet-Powered Motor", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117,            and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes,            orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such            a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible            heatpump in ones home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete            descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the            U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA             22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.

They typically have a SPARK GAP in the circuit            which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped.  It is important that the total            inductance and capacitance of the Device combine to            RESONATE at the same frequency as EARTH RESONANCE in            order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be            increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the NEUTRAL CENTER            of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a            Tesla Coil, slipping a TOROID CHOKE COIL around the            secondary coil will enhance output power.  ["Earth Energy:            Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems", by John Bigelow, 1976,            Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.]                            During the 1930s, an Austrian civil engineer named            Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an            IMPLOSION TURBINE (German name, ZOKWENDLE), after            analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped            waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it.  As described in the book "A            Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources", by Dan A. Davidson,            1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a            LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump,            which then converts the pumps motor into an ELECTRIC            GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earths rotation, via the Coriolis effect, LIKE A            TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                            A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the McClintock            Air Motor (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between            a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and            planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running            by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also            generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat            buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large            trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.             [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the            automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.]                            Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown            in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector.                            One other energy source should be mentioned here,            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free            Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph            Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION            reactor which he calls Migma, which uses NON-radioactive            deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities            from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be            converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting            steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the            "Tokamaks" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about,            Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in.  ["New Times" (U.S. version), 6-26-78,            pages 32-40.]                            And then there are the cold fusion experiments that            have been in the news lately, originally conducted by            University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin            Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake            Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of            chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with            mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which            PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated.                            There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called "laws"            of thermodynamics are NOT so "absolute".  For example, the            late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the Reciprocal System, (which he describes in detail            in several books such as "Nothing But Motion" (1979) and "The            Universe of Motion" (1984)), in which the physical universe            has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter            half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing            between them, with-OUT the "heat death" predicted by            thermodynamic "laws".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH            BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some            Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow,            seemingly converting "low-quality energy" into "high-quality            energy".                            Also, certain religious organizations such as Sant Mat            and Eckankar teach their Members that the physical universe            is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of            existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV            channels, as described in books like "The Path of the            Masters", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and "Eckankar: The Key            to Secret Worlds", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example,            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the Astral Plane.  Long-time Members of these groups            have learned to Soul Travel into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given            the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is            supported by many successful laboratory-controlled            experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as            those described in the book "Psychic Discoveries Behind the            Iron Curtain".                            In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional            energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their            VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If            the government does not intervene, then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and            pollution and its harmful effects (including the GREENHOUSE            EFFECT, acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil            spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue            to increase.                            The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development            of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize            private production (until the producers can make it on their            own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of            Free Energy Hardware.                            The long-range effects of such government intervention            would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining            companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$,            etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil,            and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero,            while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCRs,            personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease,            along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be            able to realize the "opportunity costs" of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE            USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                            Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of            business, but society as a whole, and the earths environment            and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People,            that government should serve, rather than the big            corporation$ and bank$.

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort.  She had to ask the Lady several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest...  The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. #>#The point is that theism is *a* factor. #> #>Thats your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful #>as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore #>belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this #>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods) #> #  #Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.  I have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.  #  #The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes #something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone #is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between #theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism #because of the special features of theistic belief.  Truth by blatant assertion.  Evidence? #  #  #>#>Gullibility, #>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more #>#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of #>#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators #>#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing. #># #>#Thats a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the #>#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say. #> #>If you believe that, youre incredibly naive. #> #  #You, Frank ODwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any #base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think #you are ignorant of human nature. Even when one starts with something one does #not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says. #  #To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.  The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but its there for anyone to see.  Its almost an epidemic in this country.  Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why are there churches to the square inch in my country? #  #>#>Now, *some* #>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism, #>#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned #>#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction #>#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm? #>#> #>#Thats a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to #>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to #>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, #>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism. #> #>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common #>with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isnt implied by #>what you say before, because youre trying to sneak in "innate features #>of [all] theism".  The word youre groping for is "some". #> #  #Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already #gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and #theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them #to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the #theology.  Truth by blatant assertion.   #  #  #>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them. #> #>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism, #>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed #>to the case you are trying to make? #> #  #Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people #causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the #statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you #challenged.  Indeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation of which you speak?   #  #  #>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw #>#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer. #> #>I said it reads like a warm up to that.  Thats because its an irrational #>and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us #>split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either #>side of church walls. #> #  #Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights #protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.  Of course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me. #  #It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between #that argument and the rise of fanatism.

Truth by blatant assertion.  Ive seen as many bogus proofs of the  non-existence of gods as I have of their existence.  #  #Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from #logical analysis, the point is that the evaluation of the data does not #contradict logic.

Id like to see this alleged evidence. #  #One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method #for usefulness, the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (thats not #how one feels about it).

'Though this will be addressed in the series of articles Im posting now under "ARESNOKOITIA", I cant wait.  This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim 1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of the Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th commandments and in the midst of this listing is "homosexuals."  The decalogue, above everything else, is seen as Gods absolute.  If you dont believe in absolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul reveals to be the Messiah of the NT. "Lord Christ Jesus" transliterates to read "Jehovahs Anointed Savior."     In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards) is not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for application in the NT.  As Ive said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away with.   This understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being posted.  Please refer to it.   We can do better than "probably" which is not an adequate defense against the statement that Pauls culture didnt have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours.   Again read the article because it uses facts.   I think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend, yet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is no remorse, then I feel that Pauls "pastoral" care, as presented in the Corinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer, then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldnt hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays the present "political correctness" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at the present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how the morals decay.    I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own states, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax incentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of relativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment. --Rex';3

': Ok, whats more important to gay Christians?  Sex, or Christianity? : Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex : completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, : to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, : etc?  If not, why not?  Heterosexuals abstain all the time. : (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders : to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)  The difference is that straight members are given the choice of abstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only to some.  Gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they _must_ be celibate.  I dont believe that God gives me a forced choice between having a relationship with God and expressing my heterosexuality (within the context of a faithful relationship).  Nor do I believe that God gives that forced choice to gays.  Sex or Christianity is a false dichotomy.  : To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII : starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is : this a myth).

[....]  Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.  I, on the other hand, know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10". (This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:     :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.      1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most      users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who      programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A      person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is      good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,      or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in a UNIX      hacker.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who      fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One      might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence password      hacker, network hacker.  See {cracker}.       The term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net (see {network, the} and      {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see      {hacker ethic, the}).       It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an      elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new      members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if      you claim to be one and are not, youll quickly be labeled      {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.     :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing      is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun      and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits      no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.       Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no      means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that      *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary      control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}      project.       Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.      But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as `benign crackers (see also {samurai}).  On      this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,      preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an      unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.       The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing      resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as      {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})      can function without central control because of this trait; they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdoms most valuable intangible asset.  :  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is :  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)  Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of hacker.  So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace.  (This means that hacker is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.  : >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesnt work that way. :  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)  Language works anyway that we want it to work.

'(Peter White) writes  Youve missed on very important passage.  2 Thess. 1:6-10  For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was believed.  Things to note from this passage.  Unbelievers are both those who openly reject the gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the same as the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it is separation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Dont confuse the two.   Yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.   For instance,  If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to ignite. However, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning bush that was not consumed.  Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire.   Maybe you dont understand.  There will be those who are alive at the end of the millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ.  Even those who have died in their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to receive condemnation.   This is contrary to the teaching of Scripture.   THis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the "no physical body" thesis.   The true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ.  But whether it was open rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known GOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and that every mouth will be stopped.  There will be no defense at the judgment seat of God. THerefore we understand "it is appointed unto man once to die, and then comes judgment" literally.    just because it is horrific, doesnt make it less of a reality.   it should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with others';3

'This may sound argumentative, but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships? If we do a little substitution above, we get:  "although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous men and women, there certainly is a fairly larget percentage (in my experience) who are.  I am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship.  This in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very significant ministry with the Incest association of his community..."  Do the same standards apply?  If not, why not?  And while were in the ballpark, what about bestiality?  I cant recall offhand if there are any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals; does that activity have more or less a sanction?  Please avoid responses such as "youre taking this to extremes".  I would guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at large views incest.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Cokely       | (714) 833-4760   scott.cokely@nb.rockwell.com		     "They came for the Davidians, but I did not speak up because  I was not a Davidian.

That doesnt mean that the same people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent Christs relationship to humanity.  This is at least *partly* an empirical question.    In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because over time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think thats the case with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Pauls guidelines, its possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But in practice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it.    The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note: Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation, but I would argue that its at least relevant.  You cant answer the request by asking why you shouldnt look at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such association.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at it too.  Of course that doesnt mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of why there arent groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results.';3
'In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have given the impression that even though children didnt  require baptism it wouldnt hurt if they were. To the contrary, when you baptize children before they are capable of comprehending it you deny them  their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to serve God.  Have any of you considered that children are not accountable for sin because they are not capable of  repentance? Peter said to a group of "men and brethren," "Repent and be baptized every one of you" (Acts 2:38). Notice that he specified that if they *repent* then  they may be *baptized*.  In following Peters instructions people must first demonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and  a desire to obey Gods commands) *before* they are  eligible to be baptized.  Since young children are not capable of repenting, they are not eligible for baptism. And since God is both just and merciful "sin is not  imputed when there is no law" (Romans 5:13), young  children are not accountable for what they cant  comprehend.';3

'John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:   * "The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *  *  treated as a matter of faith." -- Francis Hitching                     *    I have a few points to make about the above posting.      1. Science is not based on and does not consist of "quotes" from either     real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)     experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive     confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike     (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to     follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests     that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they     are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and this may not be your real intent.      2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his     statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the     quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.     Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context     and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate     scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may     not be your real intent.      3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of "the modern theory of     evolution" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one     line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that     disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate     claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck     proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond     of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not     actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.      4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack     on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on     science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the     fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long     ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and     irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.   Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:   * Neither I, nor Websters has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *    I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Websters B^).  Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ("The Neck of the Giraffe").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution (the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a "non sequitur" (i.e. the conclusion "does not follow"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]    Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was titled "`Giraffe sticks scientific neck out too far".  Excerpts include :    "Francis Hitchings is not a biologist."  "He goes after Darwin like Mark   Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and   pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman."  "He suggests   a mystical `organizing principle of life, using the similarity of organs   in different creatures as evidence [sic]."    Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldnt surprise me much.  Its also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e. he only posted a quote).';0

'This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Quran and have given my arguments for this.

This should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism.   So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning  more about Islam, that is by reading the Quran and understanding its  basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see  who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at  odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve  muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles  of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than  any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical  nature.';0

'When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,    the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a    likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,    it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the    Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to    believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the    authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved    private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I    suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but    if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not    orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what happened at Fatima.  Thats a bit strong, it is sort of like saying that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an offense, but not a heretic.  Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due to a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.  "Approval" of an apparition by the Church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.  I personally think of private revelations as our Lords way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.  Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into someone without a heart.';3

'Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined rules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented at the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for that case would be the citizens of the US and so on.   "Acceptable" are those behaviours which are either legislated for the society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are non-verbally and, in effect, non-consciously, such as picking your nose on the Oprah Winfrey show, no-one does it, but there is no explicit law against doing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a behaviour is "acceptable", but one can deduce these behaviours by observation.    In an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, some cultures dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals. Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, is it moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind of problem may only be definable by legislation.   Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is acceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.    One thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit all cultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally accepted mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable concept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon this earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).';0
'I am quite near sighted.  Ive recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well.  My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour.  The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.  I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments. The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most interest to me:  If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action?  If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect afterwards.  Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.  Many thanks  Bill';2

Hate begets more hate, never love. ....     In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our     neighbors. He doesnt say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he     commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. ....     - Scott  I too dislike the phrase "Hate the sin, love the sinner".  Maybe the definite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give us license to fixate on our brothers peculiar pecadillo which we have managed to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or culture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.  That said, I dont think Scott has adequately explored the flip side of this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes, Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In the New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should always actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense, it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its victims, even when these are its accomplices as well.  Maybe "mourn sin, love sinners" catches the idea slightly better than "hate", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive powerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love, and carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was devoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or grief they exemplified.  My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years back, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of AIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and abandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and brother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over Jacks death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous bureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jacks family, the inertia in Christians response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jacks own lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself shared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before his AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jacks innate sexual orientation, n.b.)  Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.';3
'[Partial deletion]  Nice explanation except that it isnt N-hydroxylation that causes the formation of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), but rather a direct two-electron oxidation. In addition, there is one school of thought that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.    As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one of the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topic can be found in:   	Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. 	 	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its 	Mechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367- 	407 (1992).  	(Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe)  I couldnt agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic dose of acetaminophen causes.  Ive heard a number of descriptions by physicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a lingering very painful death.';2
'(about my reply)   It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isnt it?   Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little about, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the lines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical insight cannot be algorithmic in his book _The emperors new mind: Concerning computers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penroses claim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look, could be just illusions.  We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, realising that it might not be anything special, but certainly useful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds or not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave  just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a "total synthesis of C. elegans" from the elements. Would such a worm have a mind?   This is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains work like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence (Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less chaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve. Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.   Indeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms.   Kevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again. I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not  flame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are conscious.   The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.  And please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics. I would say it doesnt.   Again, _brains are not computers_. Dont forget this. This does not mean they need something else to work - they just work differently. Their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action,  self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.   You are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in our brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is not how I see it. The sensation green is a certain time-dependent pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain.   Indeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns, but this is just idle speculation.  Scientific Americans September 1992 issue was a special issue on mind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-) There are two articles on visual perception, so you might be  interested.  But again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be  observed from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but  neuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind.  Kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the  patients state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area was stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.  Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations, when the patients have started flirting with the therapist.  In conclusion, there is evidence that  1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences,     brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage  2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in    various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our    visual cortex is activated etc.  3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our    actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead    of our conscious will by at least 350 ms.   Thus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question "Why do I see colours" around and ask "What is this I that seems to be  observing?", since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains.   This depends on what is meant by seeing colours. Does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?  If you are asking, "why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesnt", I have a good answer - read my previous posting, where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally, so that they dont unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme, but this is the basic idea.)  When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools,  a sense of identity and the concept of self had to evolve in line with this development. Indeed, respect for others and  conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals, such as early humans.    If minds are required for this, does this mean that until human minds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained in the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.  This has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant, since we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do physicists.    I agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)   Its OK, if you dont forget to take with you the references I wrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:  Kalat, James W.

'Robert,  Im *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  Ive  been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med. I didnt know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just  like I havent read "The Yeast Connection").  Let me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers of  recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually  left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  Im still not sure that if a  review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually  proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.  Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay  texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food  combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind. But some things I just cant buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent  oxidative damage in the body).  Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove  that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you  use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees  I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in  commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this  kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I  couldnt find a temperature for mineral ash formation so Im really  guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is  that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to  produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so  they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct.   Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and  in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve  fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we  really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with  silicon?  Not in my book Robert.  Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  Ive seen speculation  that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon  based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I  know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to  separate the fiction from the fact.  Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in  humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  Whats it doing  there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know  about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not  because silicon is transformed into calcium).  Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective  tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show  that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective  factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin,  the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity  which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as  part of the ageing process in humans).  For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which  calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon  in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the  bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming  cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in  the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of  defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also  another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an   undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not  transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing  observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into  calcium is an interesting little trick.  But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and  yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without  a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group  are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you dont know any  better).  If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base,  Im inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources  that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems  to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that Im  going to give isnt going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us  kindred souls Robert, then I guess Ill have to live with that label.  For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Roberts  interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric  neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I cant remember the network or his  name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in  our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with  brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional" treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one  case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional  treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the  cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between  radiation treatment and surgery is guys?   Im going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the  chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which  do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it  because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are? How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your  sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).';2

'I dont necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma). Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never  state why faith and dogma are dangerous.    If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in Waco, you are missing the point.    The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed everything he said.  The problem wasnt the religion, it was the  followers.  They didnt die because of faith and dogma, they died because of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their parents).   So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their religion only?  What are you saying?  Ones belief in a Christian God does not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at, but Id rather hear you expand on the subject.    Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?      So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this definition imply that one cannot change ones mind.  In prison, however, you cant just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The two are not compatible.    I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^) Seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn groups of people.  The common target is the "infidel," a curious being who is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious affiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an Egyptian. 8^)  Please explain how "just because" thinking kills people.  (And please state more in your answer than "Waco.")    Ill see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious  zealot with bad acne. 8^)  By the way, I wasnt aware mass suicide was a problem.

'Meta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin,  part II  Let me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition of male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, Ill also stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the term for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would mean for Pauls readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter than my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within Christs body, and I am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely characterizable as "liberal") will be evident, but I am not grinding an axe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD to reach "closure" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.  So; stipulating Pauls intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS READERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is a second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?  Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st Corinthians, there are two "positive" answers and one "negative" to this question:  +	a.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has 	    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem- 	    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be 	    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no 	    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence 	    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]  +	b.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul, 	    what God means "behind" Pauls inspired word-choice.)  -	c.  We *dont* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre- 	    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul, 	    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ ("those who have 	    more" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is "obvious" from 	    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB 	    translates it as "grabbers") or even _methusoi_ ("drunkards" 	    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult, 	    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)  The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards tradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical demand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.  _ad_ a:	It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the 	community of Christs disciples and their successors, and that 	our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition. 	But its also the case that we know little or nothing about this 	tradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that 	we have access to the tradition only after several generations of 	possibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only 	documentation of the tradition in the critical era.  _ad_ b:	If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an 	attempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under- 	standing the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of 	men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit 	from blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But 	the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit 	as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that 	takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent 	understanding supposedly derived from the "clear" Word of God.  		[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought 		constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even 		while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture; 		the more bizarre forms of "I will read Scripture my way" 		are primarily a fringe aspect of "cultic" Protestantism.]  	The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no 	means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel 	*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible 	conflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind 	"convinced" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously 	urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian 	against Christian.  To what purpose?  _ad_ c:	The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can 	reach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open 	to all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually 	possible. :-)  	[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias; 	one complaint against critical methodology is that it "dissolves" 	faith -- but surely a "faith" that cannot honestly face the evalu- 	ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to 	address.]  Anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between "liberal" and "conservative" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I predict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position its due, but no more than its due.   Second question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of "spiritual" Christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible, that Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against male-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi- bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But its precisely where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that theyre most dangerous.  We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of tradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them). We have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus and Peter and Paul do not so much "throw out" tradition as subject it to radical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:       "the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith" 							(Matthew 23:23) and  "On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,       and the Prophets, also." 							(Matthew 22:40)  If there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the challenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts (vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus reported words and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge.  All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may lead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and inherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is immune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy and good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from love of God and love of neighbor.  I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am too dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I *know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated "sodomites" as the "cause" of the earthquake, so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in accord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit, then I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord is that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians, for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.  And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:  	"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise, 	this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of 	its own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not 	only be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves 	fighting against God." 							[Acts 5:36...39]   All I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our first Christian witnesses willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who are NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards Gods truth. --  Michael L. Siemon		I say "You are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			Most High, all of you; nevertheless     - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince."   Psalm 82:6-7  [Theres a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to whether youre speaking of tradition in Pauls time or ours.  I think there are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and his readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition.  Thats what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex. Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background. The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with that background.  Even if the words in the sin lists arent the most general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that theres some evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of homosexuality.  But when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, thats rather a horse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a continuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Pauls original meaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted him, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition. A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent. tradition to illuminate Pauls original meaning, but not use the Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be.';3

'So do other parts of the Bible when taken literally - i.e. the Psalms saying the Earth does not move, or the implication the Earth is flat with four corners, etc.  The Bible was written to teach salvation, not history or science.   What ones?  Paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints? (Which are taught in 2 Maccabees, Sirach, and Tobit)   By your own subjective judgement.  This falling short is your judgement, and you are not infallible - rather the Church of Jesus Christ is (see 1 Timothy 3.15).   More subjective feelings.   This is not a proof of anything more than one persons feelings.   As I have written time and again, the Hebrew canon was fixed in Jamnia, Palestine, in 90 AD.  60 years after the foundation of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.  Furthermore, the opinons of Jerome do not count.  He was neither the Church, or the Pope, or an ecumenical council, or a council in general, or an insturment of the Magisterium of the Church.  He was a private individual, learned admittedly, but subject to erro of opinion.  And in exlcuding the deuterocanon, he erred, as Pope Damsus, and the Council of Carthage, and the tradition of the Fathers, clearly shows, as I pointed out in my previous post.   I suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement, if you want to take it in the sense you are taking it, that taking away from the book will cause you to lose heaven.   The order of the Canon is unimportant, it is the content that matters.  None of Jesus statments exlcude the deuterocanon, which were interspersed throughout the canon.  And remeber, there are some completely undisputed books, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiatses, Song of Songs, Job, etc. that are not quoted in the New Testament, which is not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.';3

Any belief system can leave you in such a state and so can drugs.  God(s) are not a requirement.  Only if you remove such useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon. It is that or keep on exterminating those who dont believe (or converting them).   - Eric  NEW VIRUSES:';0
'Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!  For example:  	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same 	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the 	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, 	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the 	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.  	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.  	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI 	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings, 	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic 	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.  	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but theyve also split out the 	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to 	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG 	also has doubled its membership fee.  What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they dont look so big.  But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.  Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am? ________________________________________________________________________________ Robert Reed			Home Animation Ltd.		503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com	5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068  SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS';1

'From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an introduction to the article "Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz.   	Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of 	the worlds fastest growing religions, with as many as 	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the churchs 	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one 	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world 	countries. 	 	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and 	evangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict 	authoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly 	receives revelations directly form God, and a group of 	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief 	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion, 	pornography, sexual freedom, womens rights, and other, in 	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it 	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea. 	 	Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy 	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western 	states.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft 	Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family, 	the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed 	government officials. 	 	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by 	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had 	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill 	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he 	had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of 	Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written "by 	the commandment of God," claims that the ancient Hebrews 	settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors 	of the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who 	have been baptized in the "true church" will be reunited 	after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can 	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the 	hereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been 	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and 	as heretics by religious fundamentalists. 	 	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was 	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because 	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from 	Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois, 	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham 	Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over 	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further 	westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City.  	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of 	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice 	in nineteenth-century America. 	 	While other religions go back many centuries -- 	Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism, 	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are 	difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon 	roots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this 	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny 	is dangerous to the faith. 	 	In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles 	about the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong 	member of the church, provides a detailed critical 	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of 	Mormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion 	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a 	Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the 	history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz 	  The article itself is super.';0
'I havent read this entire thread, but, if someone hasnt tossed this out yet, then here it is:   2 Samuel 12:21-23 (RSV) :     "Then his servants said to him, `What is this thing that you have   done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when   the child died, you arose and ate food. He [David] said, While the   child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who knows   whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? But   now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall   go to him, but he will not return to me."  Anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven (where David will someday go). I dont claim to know for sure if this applies to all babies or not. But even if its just this one, what would you say to this?';3
'> Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended  > with the death of St John, the last Apostle. Nothing new can be  > added.  Every so often, the Pope declares that some departed Christian is now in Heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church. It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such declarations by the Pope are infallible. I see three possibilities:      1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death of (for example) Joan of Arc.      2) The Church was given a list before the death of St John which had Joans name on it.      3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and Roman Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or even that she is a historical character.';3

'I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net before, but Im afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that "the assumption of Mary" would be better phrased "our assumptions _about_ Mary."  In all the time Ive been reading about Mary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural foundation.    I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christs parents as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to Gods working, beyond doubt.  But the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human desire.  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew temptation, albeit without submitting to it.  I also dont see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some- how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of Gods grace in being incarnated through an or- dinary human being.    I wont start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc., since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we lose part of the wonder of Gods Incarnation in Christ when we make his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.';3

'I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral.  What would then be a morality of a morality of morals.  Labels dont make arguments.  One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be interpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example "The best thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement."  whatever helps this goal is "moral", whatever does not is "immoral"  Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to fulfill a goal, one would need a "hyper-morality" to apply to just the methods.   Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think about it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut reaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate morals.

': When Elizabeth greeted Mary, Elizabeth said something to the effect that : Mary, out of all women, was blessed.  If so, it appears that this : exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.  The phrase is "eulogemene su en gunaixin"- "blessed are you among women." There is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status, only that _as a woman_ Mary was blessed.  Adding the word "all" is not a fair reading of the text.  There are some good reasons for the churchs veneration of Mary, but they cannot depend on this verse.';3

'I posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary, it was a complete technical description of the protocol. It can be ftped from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps   Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms. NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections, NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.  Im sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement it.  If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.';1
'Recently Ive come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts the immune system to a significant degree.  He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over $100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness.  If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, Id be very interested to hear about research and personal experience.

'The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian teaching concerning the death of Mary.   Also very good is "Re: Question about the Virgin Mary" by Micheal D. Walker.  He tells the story very well. I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate "The Dormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)".  The Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles who are weeping.  Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what seems to be a small child.  This is, in fact, Marys soul already with Christ in Heaven.  The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death.  It forshadows the general resurrection on the last day.  The disciples were not surprised to find Marys body missing from the grave.  She was the Mother of the Savior.  She was the first of all Christians.  She gave birth to the Word of God.  If it were not for her we would not be saved.  This is why we pray in the Orthodox Church, "Through the prayers of the Theotokos, Savior save us."';3
'In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs. One is a C program that will perform a "morph" between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there  must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is  appreciated.';1

'No smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your statement says that I was mentioning "nonsense" about atheism? This is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand.  But, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be misinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism "nonsense"? If so, care to back up that claim?   OK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I "broken"?   *YAWN* Excuse me, I dont recall any portion of my post in which I called Christians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity "silly" and then following that up with information that I was nine years old when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your gods existence. I define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", BTW.  Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types there, so in answer to your question: "no."  Finally, Id hardly call Christianity "beseiged" in this country. I seldom see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I dont know for sure, of course, I only say I havent seen it happening. What I have seen happening is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people who claim to be Christs followers. I know that this sort of thing isnt practiced by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and I dont see comperable victimization of Christians.    The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. Im not a student of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and Linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications I see are improper, please let me know. Im here because Im not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _dont_ think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see "atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesnt deserve your respect? Aw, geez. Im sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high, here. Its just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. I figure you should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to your question. Now, the smoothed feather version: I seek all sorts of knowledge. Thats why I came to my university. Yes, I am looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of Christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view. Ive been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely dont know the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists I figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), but without an atheist, you cant be sure of even one atheists motive.        Im hoping people really want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I actually think about these things. Instead, Im still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken" people are atheist. 	Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they  discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didnt follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions so successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which  "breaks" people. Its an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another reason Im here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as  a watchdog for logical fallacies :).                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The implication here being that atheists cant possibly know anything about Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my reaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that atheists are "broken", hostile people. This post confirms that someone else believes it.                                                ^^^^^^^^^^  Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies lack of existence. However, I havent met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a "seeker" if you like, I dont.  _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say "I dont believe in any god" rather than my position: "I believe that no god(s) exist." For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve, because they dont actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and Methodists from an atheist point of view :). This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in something (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). Guess what? My atheism ends the moment Im shown a proof of some gods existence. Is that really too much to ask?    Well, I guess you wont succeed in converting him or me. Why the supposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is it because you yourself are unconvinced? :)   And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how. I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe thats how Im "broken"? I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you think. All I ask for is proof of the assertion "God exists". Logical or physical proofs only, please. Then well discuss the nature of "God".  Prayer?! Uh, oh, well have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)   Good luck to you, as well.

'In <May.13.02.31.16.1993.1569@geneva.rutgers.edu> djohnson@cs.ucsd.edu   Im afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:  	Whats more important to Christians?  Love of God or love 	of other human beings?  to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like the other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any "flavor" of Christianity which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a "priority" over the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let the dead bury the dead, to "hate" family rather than let it keep us from following Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our fellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us to the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different level than the one who is so caught up in "love" of God.  The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it has sometimes been the case that the Church has "taught" that all sex was nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental homes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the vehicle of becoming "one flesh" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what is wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I mean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social interaction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of marriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and foster the children they beget and support their childrens mothers. This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus citation of that passage.)  	[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as 	  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes 	  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not 	  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the 	  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are 	  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of 	  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]  Yes, of course it sometimes goes "wrong" -- like all else we do, it is infected with sin, and you find married "couples" where there is no bond, and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation (the "infatuation", "falling in love" phase) that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away. Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love -- but in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with Gods grace under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil is watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)  So, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT Christians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable to him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the hard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the "proper" preparation for an immediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints have the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication, mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in the type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We are human, and little good comes of trying to "mortify the flesh" to the point of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.   It depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us "stumbling blocks" I am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.  There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift, and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics, and indeed for all Gods creation, that can develop to the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded in sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance; telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?) is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet another prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some *particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.';3

'This is true, but its not quite the whole story.  There were  	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology 	who also replicated the phantom leaf effect.      One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography     is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the     hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic     or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at Londons     City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research      named A.

'Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients, systemic candida infection.  I think "The Yeast Connection" is a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well nutrition is taught, anyway?  Well, maybe Im getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds,  depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?

'Edgar Pearlstein asks (Fri 7 May 1993) whether the Supreme Court, or any other government authority, has attempted a legal definition of religion.  The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose "religious training and belief" was opposed to participation in war in any form. It defined "R T & B" as "an individuals belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code."  In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER, the Supreme Court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit     We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression "Supreme    Being" rather than the designation "God," .... the test of belief    "in a relation to a Superme Being" is whether a given belief that    is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its    possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God    of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption.

'Cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population.  From the responses Ive received to that post (all from men, by the way) I get the impression that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the need or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex.  With tv programs about "boobs" (Seinfeld) and "masturbation (again Seinfeld) and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States, I would not assume that we Americans are frightened of sex.

'Note:  the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank  daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to  daniels@math.ufl.edu  	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups. 	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in the Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston):  	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its roots go back that far, but these were really "influences" on the Movement, and not the actual movement, per se. 	I will start in c.1920. 	In that day, there were white churches and colored churches in nearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly colored phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism, emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. 	Many white Protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was in full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it. 	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950s and  1960s), many white church groups began to be influenced by the black churches and by what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late 60s.  In 1969, even the Catholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other  groups...still evident today.  	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant group.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it was generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly  resistant to change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo. 	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it unfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to college students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus  Evangel- ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large, played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people  began to speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did). 	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of  Christ. In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or  for advocating the "Holy Spirit Movement", another name for the new branch.  The term "Underground Church of Christ" also came into use because these people  had to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised). 	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never  really caught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville, FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street,  and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also  seemed to put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking. 	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to be its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregations (lead) Minister.  In the late 60s/early 70s, the congregation worked with  many other groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring  Break. They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus. They also worked with UF sports people. 	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed. When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer appropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name that would become legendary.  	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didnt start it, they  continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going. 	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at Crossroads. 	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require  attendance at all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of your problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer  Partners, which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while. 	The book called "The Master Plan of Evangelism" was a strong influence on Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every persons duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing in number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important). 	A person who "was evangelistic" was "spiritual".  Evangelism meant inviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them converted, then you were "spiritual".  There were sermons about how if you bought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these people needed Jesus, you should be "aggressive"--dont take no for an answer. 	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called "lazy" or "unspiritual". 	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated  into a structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then the group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had someone placed over them. 	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads began to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus was tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its "pushy" evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ to be "dead" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.  	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100) where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but also they were sending out "planting" [create a new church] and  "reconstructing" [reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the Crossroads Movement was underway. 	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in  Boston, MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a fraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of church authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s), and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the  congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over- one Christianity.  [Called this by critics] 	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want  to be a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into the new Boston Church of Christ. 	Ah, but Im ahead of myself. 	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on the members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but they were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were dropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely "unproductive" and "unfruitful".  The "fruit" passages in the NT were  interpreted as referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15,  you would be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.] 	If you love your neighbor, youll save his soul (invite him to church and convert him).  If youre not doing that, you dont love your neighbor. And if you dont love, youre in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments continue in this vein. 	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to  recurring sins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.   For by now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most Crossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should be on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.] 	Chucks replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the Boston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer training  sessions for other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross- roads ready to emphasize the "total commitment" to the church that Boston and Kip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at  Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision. Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their  belief that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston  Churches of Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since Crossroads was no longer the example to the rest of the Movement.  The group now numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership). 	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called Lordship baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized.  You had to count the cost.  At Boston, they took this a step further.  If at some time you became "unproductive", then your spirituality was suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you were getting into.  Anyone who said no had their baptism deemed invalid:   they hadnt counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others  called this "rebaptism", and Crossroads didnt approve of this practice. 	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its members left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were now called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing)  or you were "dead".  They also used the nickname "Movement of God" for a while. 	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now stood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ, and now none in the Movement.  	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following.  They sent "reconstruction teams" to many cities,  which usually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging  other churches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the "remnant". The "remnant" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was felt that the "remnant" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they would simply call their Movement "the church". 	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the other Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many campuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that Boston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to  have access to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed "perse- cution", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really a Christian if youre not being persecuted? 	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have fought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their lifes purpose) as God commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience.  	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the Cult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult, under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The term "cult" is usually differentiated from "sect" by the practice of those techniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding Discipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many others have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt  motivation, emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort of mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.  	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer- ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a falling out with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they  teach. I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system. I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their mistakes either. 	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much victims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When members do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel personally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power. They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.  	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many examples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston  bulletins) that I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this if you so desire.

'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought Id do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, theres a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used for the results Id been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  Thats right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. Id try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I dont think its entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTimes normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didnt work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I cant believe that QuickTimes synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac systems task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldnt see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...';1

Speak directly.  If the Lord has given you something to say, say it. But, before I declare "thus sayeth the Lord", Id better know for certain without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely certain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.  Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fears in this area would be the following:  1--that the people would be misled 2--that people would lose respect for christianity 3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies 4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent Gods Word,    my calling would be lost forever.  Gods Word would command the people    never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My    bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but    I could never again be a prophet of God.  In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the world of Gods Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate, cowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it is critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and in prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.  In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging one another, claiming "rights" that are not theirs, denying rights that do indeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the "gods" of this world, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel good.  Its time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in contrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, "thus sayeth the Lord", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right. When we say were christians, we really mean it.

'There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  The  few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher ently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it).   Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium will increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used t o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just as well as anabolic steroids).

'I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination, grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity.  At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Dont say it couldnt happen to you, or that it hasnt happened to others, even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.  Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.';0

'Paul-  	You did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to  offend us Catholics; hopefully I can be just as careful in my wording as you were. 	I also dont want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of debate (anymore than it already is), but just a note or two:  	1.  Please dont talk about Jesus "parents"--the doctrinal positions 		of the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and 		Joseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being 		attributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is, 		no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven, 		immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to 		Mary.  	2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our 		doctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a  		significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only 		source of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred  		traditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no 		problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a 		unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early  		generation that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul, 		etc. etc.  It wasnt until the reformation that these doctrines 		were called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my 		personaly feelings) if its a choice between the apostles or 		Luther, Ill choose the apostles every time, whether or not 		it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men 		have determined to be "the bible".';3
'The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best, yet Christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor.

'This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and Im posting my answer  here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human  nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do  when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the  mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and  their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that  most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by  diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting  your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is  justified.  From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most  physicians dont recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here is  everything that you would ever want to know about PMS.  Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:  	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression) 	anxiety			depression 	irritability		forgetfulness 	insomnia		confusion 	depression		lethargy  	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration) 	craving for sweets	weight gain 	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness 	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 	 2. palpitations 	 3. fatigue or fainting   PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low  progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a womens cycle.  PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple  carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a womens cycle, there is  increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose  challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are  a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia  is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of  hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. 	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium  supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of  the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources  of alpha linoleic acid.  PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal  phase of a womens cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead  toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal  phase). "Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human  endometrial cystol" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).  PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated  serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E  for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H  This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:  	A. "Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for  	    a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine.  	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.  	B. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension  	    syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).  	C. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)  Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can  find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one  that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work,  supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really  has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida  blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental  controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to  see done).  Here are a few of these studies:  	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat,  	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet  	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy  	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive  	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories  	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary  	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant  	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in  	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as  	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling,  	tenderness and nodularity.  	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in  	premenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).   	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU  	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored  	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of  	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the  	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool  	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this  	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose  	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10%  	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.   	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS  	symptoms.  	Experimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with  	vitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts  	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their  	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.   	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in  	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of  	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year  	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms  	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the  	vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.   These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal  store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins  given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best  single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid  (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full  of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent  the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you dont want to be trying  to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin  A toxicity.  	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxine 	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover  	trial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49  	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.   	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another  	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of  	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS  	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.  	Experimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6  	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol  	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received  	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence  	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related  	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as  	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)   	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6  	supplementation.  Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control  pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.   Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per  day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R.  Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in  Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be  considered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the  patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin  B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each  day.    	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha- 	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod.  	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3  	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a  	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast  	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant  	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38%  	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo  	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant 	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.  	Experimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on  	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr.  	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly  	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After  	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly  	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly  	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H 	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve  	PMT-H symptoms). 	 	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis  	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache  	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg  	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a  	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and  	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index  	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment  	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual  	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in   	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower  	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer  	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised  	into the normal range.  	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully  	relieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991).  	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid  	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the  	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received  	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster  	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the  	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were  	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on  	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by  	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium  	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes  	that occur during PMS.  There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the  medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder  that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But  since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med.  to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are  also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on  multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  Ive chosen the  best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out  that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors dont recognize  nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri,  pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor  being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS  is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional  disorders.  Its time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.  Heres some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral  supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.  	Experimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on  	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med.  	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and  	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E,  	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to  	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate  	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an  	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that  	they no longer suffered from PMS.    	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing  	premenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).   	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite  	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet  	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the  	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased  	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel  	phase of their cycle.  	Experimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects  	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J.  	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12  	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a  	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another  	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this  	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on  	PMS symptoms was observed.

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort.  She had to ask the Lady several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest...  The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.  (Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water  flowing.)';3

'The Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev. John Fife, visited our church about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--its been a busy week for our small church!!).  He was asked specifically about the issue of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next month.  Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range the gamut from "outlawing" homosexuality altogether to "legalizing" it completely.  He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult issue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  Without question, the issue may split the church again after weve been reunited for all of a dozen years or so.  He is hopeful that it will not and is pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion issue last year as a solution.  He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the members of the church "Agree to Disagree" on the issue, admitting that both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead them to different conclusions.  It worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view.  -- Cliff Slaughterbeck           |  Dept. of Physics, FM-15       |   Its time for the sermon on the University of Washington      |   Grand Torino!

Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart  disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to  encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do  most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from  the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to  be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have  a problem with one of these diseases, dont use what Im going to tell you  or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go. Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help  you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment  program(but the odds are that you will not and thats why Im here).  When  my wife detected a lump in here breast I didnt say, dont worry my vitamin  E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician,  plan and simple.  If its begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet  change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation  and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctors office as fast as  your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a  regular basis, my wife kept putting hers off, both myself and her  gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even  scheduled one, but she didnt show up(too busy running the Operating Room for  the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).  One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses  high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is  absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have  drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is  really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and  minerals are being used.  Im not saying that some of this stuff couldnt  be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a  lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.Ds who wrote the new  Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab  tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet  changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you  handle stress.  Thats where Im coming from folks.  Blast away if you want, Im not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really  dont care.  Im averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think  that Ive got something important to say.  But Im also getting hit by a  few with an axe to grind.  Thats life.  Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very  important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor (GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine  and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to  form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast, and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is  seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral  chelate(chromium picolinate) its absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest  for all the minerals).  Ive been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has  come up there several times as a "fat burner".  Chromium is among the least  toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really  do any harm.  I wouldnt do it though.  The adequate and safe range for  chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about  30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many  believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I  can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in  Type II diabetes but Im not going to because for each positive one, there  also seems to be a negative one as well.  Im convinced that the problem is  bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when  chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to  Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and  glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is  concerned  Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease,  this possible link with chromium isnt too surprising.  Glucoma is a little  more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin  responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity  is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular  pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with  glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll.  Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt  people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing,  just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless  they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often  found in older people, its not too surprising that chromium was low in the  RBCs.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would  prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to  check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.  You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC  chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a  RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail  analysis for you, but I wouldnt use them.  There is just too much funny  business going on in these unregulated labs right now.  Heres Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider  chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is  available(they dont like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they  also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not  routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change  and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical  response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium  supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of  CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.  Whats my advise?  Dont take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then  exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most  Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have  a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.   When he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say,  please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgans new Clinical Nutrition textbook  and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose  tolerance.  If you cant do that, Ill find a doctor who can, thank you  very much.';2

'Probably because it IS rape.   So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesnt give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even particularly attractive.   Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.   This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or ones ignorance.  Someone else will address this Im sure, and refer you to plenty of documentation...   How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.   Well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.  If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will "feel" right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction... I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness. --   --Adam';0

'No.  It is very relevant.  Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are topically aranged together in the law.  This is very important. Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there is no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and  is "holy, just, and good" as is written in the New Testament, then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.    Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships?  Isnt that bordering on sophistry?  The point we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts. Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors. The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.    I do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is  the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after. So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation.   And the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships between adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay  for adults to  have caring relationships with one another.';3

'Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.  Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,  bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.   CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum. I dont know.  =================================';2
'^^^^^^^^^^  The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.  As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.';2

'Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme (LZW?).  IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga. It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga. The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.

'Another article that fell between the cracks:   As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.  Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any evidence *in* the Bible? I sure havent found any...  Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles. Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is "No Martyrs for a Lie": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting.  Since we dont even know how or where they died, we certainly dont have this information.  (By the way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  [See 1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests of Baal].';0

'I dont think Joe was saying any such thing.  However, your question on "asking Jesus to come into your heart" seems to imply that infants are not allowed to have Christ in theirs.  Why must Baptism always be viewed by some people as a sort of "prodigal son" type of thing; i.e. a sudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly accepting Christ?  Why cant people start out with Christ from shortly after birth, and build their relationship from there?  After all, does a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  From my experiences, Ive learned that all relationships must be built, including ones relationship with God.     Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a ritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient.  Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ it is necessary to believe in Him.  However, the Sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption into Gods family on the soul.';3

TYPE:  ====  The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo- gue. The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement, dissent, or  controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather, the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga- tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter.   The moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:  Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu> Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca>    A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM: ===============================================           The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of this movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to  be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the  fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.          The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of  divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to  openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns  against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement, but so far to no avail.          Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds.          The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movements internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood.   NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================          The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news- group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than "NO/dont create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created.    ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER:  ====================          Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora- do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party.  QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS: =====================          Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to:      Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>';3

'Early in Church history, the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration  of the Eucharist.  It WAS secret, giving rise to the rumors that Christians were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims.  The actions were considered too holy to be observed by non-Christians, as well as potentially dangerous for the individual Christian who might be identified.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --';3
'Until recently I always understood the term "kingdom theology" to mean the  theology of the kingdom of God, but now I have discovered that there is a  new and more specialized meaning. I gather that it is also called "Dominion  theology", and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a  theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again.  I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but I am told  that it is a very widespread belief in the USA.  Can anyone give me any more information about it?  Here are some of my questions:  1. Is it the teaching of any particular denomination? If so, which? 2. Where and when does it start? 3. Are there any particular publications that propagate it? 4. Are there any organizations that propagate it?';3

'I saw a 3 hour show on PBS the other day about the history of the Jews. Appearently, the Cursades(a religious war agianst the muslilams in the holy land) sparked the widespread persecution of muslilams  and jews in europe. Among the supporters of the persiecution, were none  other than Martin Luther, and the Vatican.  Later, Hitler would use Luthers writings to justify his own treatment of the jews.';0

'Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who?  I had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said that when she and my father were raising we four children, they did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised in their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be alienated from them and it would create problems.   In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.   What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and never absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that I may someday be held responsible for the things that offended Him...sins that the "world" told me were OK.   My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised four extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more complete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice and punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many grave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change...but I shouldnt have married to person in the first place ) and more....   My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or counsel.   Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they *did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able to say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and compassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you.   This life is "but dust". As long as the comfort of this life is our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those with whom we come in contact.   I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who support the "right" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality, or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving friend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that what I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me living the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent people. (wouldnt kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..) It is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer life to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend. Think about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that a friend is in error, but you dont want to "cause trouble". Righteous prayers is great power, but dont forget that we are we are Christs lips and hands on earth. Dont be afraid to simply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a fervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance. In more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brothers keeper.';3
'----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------  -- WHAT IS LightWave? --  LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a device called the "Toaster" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.  -- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --  This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group.  -- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --  Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software, Im sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.  You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!  -- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --  To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain  Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon.  There shouldnt be too much of a delay in joining.  Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!  -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --  Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the following address:          lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com  Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This doesnt mean it hasnt been posted to the list.  In fact, just the opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldnt be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address.  NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.  -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --  Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain  I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you.   -- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --  I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates.  If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>  I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please send a mail message to:          fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com  The first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".  Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile. Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service. Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.    -- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --  Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>  If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact me at the address:          lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com  Cheers,';1

'Im a nursing student, and I would like to respond to #66966 on haldol and the elderly. Message-ID: <25APR199316225142@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu> Organization: Florida State University - School of Higher Thought News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1    First, Im sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go through this.  I know it has to have been tough.  There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of the body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between medications can cause confusion.  As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after the drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything to that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information. I can see what I can find...  I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to the Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitation associated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  It also should not be  discontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting effects.  Because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know what else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able to answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information, I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have happened.';2

'[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.]  In reverse order:  1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you look carefully.  2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it saves out 8 bit images - of course!  XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy facility, not a bug.  How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group related colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated.  If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.  And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space ;-)  Later,  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road,  Manchester, UK.

'Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally (not) interested in God, because without religious revelation there is _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and the theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different opinion on a matter of little practical importance.   Sorry, but that doesnt help. What test will you apply to decide whether it is God or Satan with whom you are speaking? How will you know that you have not simply gone insane, or having delusions? You are like a loaded gun.

'Who is Ram Das?  According to his brochures, he is a.k.a. Richard Alpert, PhD, and is somehow associated with the:    Seva Foundation   8 N. San Pedro Road   San Rafael, CA  94903  and the:   Hanuman Foundation    524 San Anselmo Ave #203   San Anselmo, CA  94960  He speaks publically on such topics as "Consciousness & Current Events," and has written some books and recorded some tapes on  similar subjects.    Why do I care?  My wife wants to go to one of his lectures.  When I asked why, she said Ram Das was "the greatest spiritual leader of our time!"  Several years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult, and we went through 9 months of hell that almost ended our marriage  before she quit.  Lets just say Im concerned about this Ram Das and her interest, especially so with the recent religious cult events from Texas.

'First off, if Im not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat, not humans.  Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in laymans terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be turned into heat.  2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930s for weight reduction.  In controlled amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous. It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than play around with 2,4-DNP.';2

'Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I will post a summary of their capabilities.  I havent actually used one or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  Id like to see an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or something.  Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DECs ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are binary compatible with Digitals OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by simply adding "transformation engines".  The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.   			3400			3500  CPU			DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz	DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz On-chip cache		8k/8k			8k/8k Onboard cache		512K			512K Word Size		64-bit			64-bit Memory ( initial )	32-128MB		32-256MB Memory ( future )	512MB			1GB SPECMARK89		111			126 SPECINT92		75			84 SPECFP92		112			128  GRAPHICS  Transform Modules	1-6			1-6 Frame Buffer Modules	5,10,20			5,10,20 Frame Buffer		1280x1024x24bit		1280x1024x24bit 			double buffered		double buffered Z-buffer		24-bit			24-bit Alpha/stencil		8-bit			8-bit Stereo support		yes			yes Other:				both machines will double buffer or do 				stereo output per window.

When Arabic words, especially technical ones, become of use  let us define them for those, especially atheists, to whom they may not be terribly familiar.

I conditionally retain this reference in regard to Khomeinis advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the  so-called "Twelve Imams," which is in clear conflict with the Quran  in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example higher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Quran shows that the Prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your abstruse theological statment regarding the "natures"  of the Twelve Imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the  remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad,  something which verges on the sin of association.

'I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as confirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was not explicitly condemned.  For myself, as a Catholic, I see my own opposition to capital punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a reverence for life. Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case is often let down by the explicit link which those on the political left make with anti-abortionists and pro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people who hold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were many more anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end this kneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing, and get many to think seriously about the issue (there are plenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing reason).  I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by "authority".';3

But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and its a done deal. Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, "Well, we sold him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad for Kuwait."  No, unfortunately, sitting back and "letting things be" is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Husseins military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.

'Any opinions on Burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current     status of his research would be appreciated.  Burzynskis work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against leukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)  Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1 and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been extracted from A-2. He also hasnt shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous system, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.  It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynskis theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying peptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10 does not appear to have been tested for its potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.  Many of Burzynskis statements about the origin of his theory, early research, past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue.   sdb';2

'Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium "cures diabetese".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take.  "High blood pressure" - I have never heard of this claim before.  "... anabolic steroids" - I have also never heard of this claim before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?       I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isnt likely to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health.  It is important to exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).  Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the statistics.  You wouldnt believe these anyway.  Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role in "sensitizing" the bodys tissues to the hormone insulin. Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose weight (4).  Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparing" effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulin, chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the fat theyve lost.  Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin. Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories, so its not at all surprising that insulin  stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.  In summary, you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy:    A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.      - Eating fat makes you fat.    B. Increase dietary fiber      - low in calories; high in nutrients.    C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week      - burn calories.    D. Take chromium picolinate daily      - lose fat; keep muscle   References:  1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

'We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesnt seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!  (Note to IBMers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed through proper channels so Im not giving away any new unpublished info.)';1
'The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group. That particular FAQ (Ive forgotten the author) discusses the traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and indicates which points have strong textual support.  Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the FAQ on this topic?  BTW, this issue, while dealt with before, is VERY timely.  One of the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a  MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of  Synod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which  covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a  pro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated. [This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.] 					Tim  [I think its time for me to post the FAQ.    This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church.  On the other side, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do so.  And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said they couldnt install a homosexual pastor has made her an "evangelist".  These situations, as well as the one you describe, do not appear to be stable.  This will certainly be a major topic for the General Assembly next month.  If the church cant come up with a solution that will let people live with each other, I think were end up with a split.  Clearly neither side wants that, but I think well get pushed into it by actions of both sides.';3

'If I get a chance I will ask them this weekend.                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A "quick look" doesnt do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point. The clash between Jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily in the theological realm. The "false prophets" understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant, which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of Davids descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of Davids upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies. The "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded with theological meaning.  In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson "New York will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.  --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---';3
':                                                               Consequently, : this verse indicates that she was without sin.  Also, as was observed at : the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the : mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin.  If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give birth to God, then why didnt Marys mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus?  For that matter, why didnt Marys grandmother have to be without sin either?  Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing through each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have none puts God in a box, where we say that He couldnt have incarnated Himself through a normal human being.  My God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His purpose.  This includes creating a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age; providing a path through the Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal sinful person without being tainted by her original sin.  I see far too much focus on the "objects" of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to all believers with the Author of our existence, without the necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits to God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope.  : Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the : Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned : during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also : held by the Catholic Church.  If Mary was born without original sin, and didnt sin during her lifetime, how is she any different from Jesus?  This means the world has had two perfect humans:  one died to take away the sins of the world;  the other gave birth to Him?  I would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start praying to anyone other than God.  Everything I have ever read from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless Lamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........  : Hope this is useful to you.  Very useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs. Thank you.';3
'The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence of this "syndrome".  To date, these claims are unsubstantiated by any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based upon their data.  Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than "Aunt Susies brother-in-law ...".  Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis, but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues, and so evidence of exceptions does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.  I would characterize it not as abject disbelief but rather  scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions.  I have no problem with such an approach; but this is NOT what is happening in the trenches of this diagnosis.';2

The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:  The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes "Computer Graphics" book is certainly a good start.  Chapter 6 is "Viewing in 3D", then read chapter 15, "Visible-Surface Determination".  For more information go to chapter 16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.   3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.  Find a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" by Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH 82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).  A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293.  Note that the code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site, as described above.  Check out John Bradleys "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual.  The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower".  Theres also an implementation of:  Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988), pp. 153-162.  avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code, in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.   4) Converting color into grayscale.  The NTSC formula is:      luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue   5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.  The only reference you need for this stuff is:      Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6  But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion.   6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.  The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source. This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling.  However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface 86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears in "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title.   7) Free image manipulation software.  There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions. Here are pointers to some of them:      xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format     conversion package.

There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for details on some.  Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this.  You may find useful information there.   8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.  You almost certainly dont need these.  Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.  These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.  A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently, neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.  FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. Its a file format most often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.    9) Converting between vector formats.  A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.  There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac. A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.  On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive site.  A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for PCs allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Suns X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if youre clever.  But in general, the answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial.  GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2).   10) How to get Pixar films.  The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:      Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price     Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00     Reds Dream				$19.95			$75.00     Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00     Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00     Luxo, Jr./Reds Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00  All tapes are on 1/2" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also available:      Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00     Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)  For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add $3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international, 213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify prices and availability.  Or, just write to:      Direct Cinema Limited     1749 14th Street     Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342  Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:  At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe its available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixars address).      Pixar     1001 West Cutting Blvd.     Richmond, CA. 94804     (510) 236-4000      (510) 236-0388 (FAX)  You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains "Luxo, Jr.", "Reds Dream", "Tin Toy" and "Knicknack" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I  ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Dont expect  to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.   11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?  The short answer is, "You cant."  Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to do the job right, consult the article:    "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles"   by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller   in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,   September, 1989, pages 48-56.  For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:    Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture   by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,   Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.  For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:    "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"   by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken   in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),   June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]   12) How to order standards documents.  The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900, mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the complete name and number.  Some useful numbers to know:  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmers Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.  Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179.   13) How to FTP by email.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.   14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.  Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines article in Glassners ray tracing book (above) for more information, including treatment of special cases.  Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.  Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.   15) How to tessellate a sphere.  One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. Its available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.  16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.  Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:  Highlights of this edition-      i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through        November 91;     ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG         International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, 91;     iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;     iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;     v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.  The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long. Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. Its named "speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites-               Site                             Dir 	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ 	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/ 	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/ 	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics 	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/  Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies.  These are in "refer" format, and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as "RayBib.*" and "RadBib.*".  Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This collection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*".  17) SIGGRAPH information online  [from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]  ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org (128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.  The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories.  To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to      archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with the command      send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.   18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available  [from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]  ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH 91 Panels Proceedings at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available in three formats:      text   (ASCII)      rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)      word   (MS Word for the Macintosh) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:  (1) by anonymous ftp     change to one of the directories        publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]     The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word     files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary      mode.      Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the     contents of each panel file.  (2) by electronic mail     send mail to        archive-server@siggraph.org     You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you     first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages        send panel91-txt index        send panel91-rtf index     in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary     information to retrieve the actual transcript files.   19) Graphics mailing lists  There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing.  Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats, no software       (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).       Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.   21) What about GIF?  GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I dont like it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.  Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc, 	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, 	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers  Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:  /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of:  send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Send a message containing "help" to get general information about the mail server.  Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and 20 above for more information.   22) What is morphing?  Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:          morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)         morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)         m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)  The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards.   23) How to ray-trace height fields  Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.  The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:  F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July, 1988 <musg88.ps.Z>  This is available as "Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639" from Yale University, its also in the SIGGRAPH 91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes, and (best of all) its available on the net:      nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z     weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z     gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z  An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

Pn, not in the x-y plane, is given by       Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |  where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal to P0.   25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH  Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM. Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00, Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)  SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions on Graphics) its another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or Associate Members.  If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, itll cost you $59.00 (no student discount).  There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.  ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet.  Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318. Snailmail address:                  ACM                 PO Box 12114                 Church Street Station                 New York, New York 10257  SIGGRAPH `93 will be held in Anaheim, California, at the Anaheim Convention Center (just up the street from Disneyland) on August 1-6, 1993.  26) Where can I find MRI and CT scan volume data?

Being my anxiety level is peaking and you folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what you people think regarding my previous post. To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.  as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)  3 schools i heard nothing from at all.  I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no info whatsoever to tell me.  I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles and a few "safety"  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first to reject me)  my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art history, politics etc   Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.

'Dear Netters:   I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a  concave polyhadra.

So I wonder if there exists  public domain source code for this.

How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case.

'SREBRENICAS DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWNS LIVING HELL       By Laura Pitter     TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August.     But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnias bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon.     ``Now Im a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally thats the greatest license a surgeon could have.     Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla, the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there.     ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce, he told reporters.     Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections.     He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000 patients.     He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said.     His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children.     The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street, he said.     ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.     Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.     The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didnt know the basic principles for amputating limbs.     Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-September he had run out of supplies.     ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands, he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding.     ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations, he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.     ``I felt destroyed psychologically, Mujanovic said.     The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.     But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.     Then the hunger set in.     Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.     ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation, he said.     According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.     Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.     ``They say Im a hero, he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.';2

'Here is the short answer: because only certain marriages are recorded in Heaven.  Now for the long answer:  In Doctrine and Covenants section 132, the  chapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes, plural marriage), the distinction between sealings under the priesthood and other  marriages is revealed.    When "the children of this world marry, or are given in marriage" when they receive "the  resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage" (Luke 20:34-35). Jesus was simply teaching that marriages "until death do you part" are not in force after death.  However, the Doctrine and Covenants continues  describing eternal marriage.  D&C 132:19    And again, verily I say unto you, if a  man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed this power and the keys  of this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity AI] and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels,  and the gods, which are set there, to their  exhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been  sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a  fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.  The Lord told Peter "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matt 16:19). Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to  perform sealings? Peter thought so because he taught that husbands and wives were "heirs *together* of the grace of life" (1 Peter 3:7).  "In order to obtain the highest" (degree of celestial glory), a man must enter into this order of the priesthood" (D&C 131:2). When a man and wife are sealed they truly become  "one flesh" because their eternal "increase"  (destinies) are enjoined completely.  Our Father has an eternal companion (and maybe more because of the plural marriage conditions of the law) who participated in our creation and is equally concerned with our progress here.  There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine. If fact, the only mention of our Mother is in one verse of a hymn written early in the history of the Church:      O My Father      I had learned to call thee Father,     Through thy Spirit from on high,     But, until the key of knowledge     Was restored, I knew not why.     In the heavns are parents single?     No, the thought makes reason stare!     Truth is reason; truth eternal     Tells me Ive a mother there.  Why dont we hear more about our Mother?  1.  Because our Father presides under Priesthood authority (which is not a calling for Her);  2.  Because we dont all (necessarily) have the same Mother it would be confusing for worship;  3.

In this news group, the liberals dont even know what a fundamentalist is (crying out "legalist" at anyone who believes and obeys Gods Word). A fundamentalist would train their children in the way God proscribes, not in the way that man proscribes.  This would not include life threatening beatings but would include corporal punishment.   To the liberals, I cry out infidel at anyone who does not believe Gods Word.  Signature follows: "Your statutes are wonderful: therefore I obey them."  Psalm 119:129 ========================================================================= David L. Hanson Any opinions expressed are my own!  [As most people here know, I believe fundamentalist is sufficiently ill-defined that I advise using some more specific term.  I think many people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution).  While the original fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think most people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original agenda.  (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  the virgin birth.)  The term is now being used by the press to describe aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who are attempting to legislate religion.  Legalism is yet another ill-defined term.  However there is some reason for its use in this context.  In fact the common theological definition is the believe that salvation is through the Law.  I hope no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this view.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we expect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects to find specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating this approach talk about the relevant passages from Pauls letter as Gods Law.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the culture and other things.  Its easy to see why a liberal would regard the conservative approach as legalism.  Its hard to know quite what other term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because no one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the question is whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling the positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I havent seen any good alternative.';3

When you say (paraphrased) #in (2) that this is not "evidence for [benefactor]", for example, what you #mean is that its no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].  Yes, thats what I mean.  #In (3), however, youve shifted the meaning of "evidence for [benefactor]" #so that it now means `absolute "evidence for [benefactor]" rather than #`relative "evidence for [benefactor]" w.r.t. [bug].  Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say, in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions (prayer, your Rapture example), I dont buy your use of Occams razor in all cases where A=0.  In my example, one couldnt dismiss [benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh.  I brought up the one-by-one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what youre saying in this post, it seems you agree, and were talking at cross-purposes.  #(3) is still in contradiction to (1). # #Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account: # #  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1 # #Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so its either the benefactor *or* a bug #which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then # #   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d) # #so # #   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1 # #but (3) implies that # #   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.  No, this isnt what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with necessarily no new observation (weve already seen the dosh) to change those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And thats precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.    Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds that the answer cant be known, or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).  #> As they do when the set M is filled by "the universe is caused by x", #> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation #> tends to one conclusion over the other. # #Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we dont "throw out" any of #these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.  Some people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science. My sole point was that they arent.  #>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x #>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite #>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the #>> hypotheses out. # #> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear. # #You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.  I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.  #> What Im trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of #> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for #> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isnt true that those for #> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor. # #On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which #can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this #thread.  Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which means that youre assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though weve already established that its not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over all i.  #> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or #> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and #> at worst barking mad. # #Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions. You wouldnt be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank? #Although that doesnt, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case #(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al). # #But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is #"evidence against" an hypothesis, that doesnt imply that observation of #the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the #estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, its still #evidence against H.  No, I got that.  Im talking about the case when A=0.  Youre clearly correct when A!=0.   And Im not constructing a strawman (though its certainly possible that Ive misunderstood what youre saying).  However, by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely, and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either dont exist, or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this (including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain a fallacy upon close examination.  If thats not what youre saying, then please put me straight.';0
'I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated by dithering.

The problem is that XV cant (I think) convert images automatically, and the obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) dont even get close to XVs quality.

'Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence and modesty, and their importance.        The Most Beautiful Virtues      This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by     Johann Christoph von Schmid       In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,	there     lived  an  upright	and  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was     married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in     a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-     ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacobs wife	died,     leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even     as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,     her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss     towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare     and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such     indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one     looked upon an angel.      Marys greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-     ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved     to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her     gender.  When	she  once, early in March brought the first violet to      Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-     ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes     itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in     retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-     ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be     like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to     attract the public	eye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in     quietude and peace.      One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the     garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,     as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which	was  beaming  in  the     morning sun:      Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem      of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-     test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:     they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure     and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the     hardest  				   -5-            to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;	touch     it	but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the     same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!       Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More     beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to     the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure     of	heart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the     suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,     as	she  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.     The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with     their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least     indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and	wan,  and  go     before their time to the grave."         Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one     that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not     much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle     of	the garden. Marys father had planted it the day that she was     born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it     blossomed  earlier	than  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The     tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that     she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at      it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father      Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling     of	red  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of     flowers!      The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes     once  more	upon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the     frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all     become  brown  and	yellow	and  when  the	sun came forth in its     strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter     tears at the sight. Then said the father:      Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my     child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced     from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree     an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way     - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has	raised	in  my	heart     should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,     then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed     over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your     cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I     should  				   -6-            go down sorrowfully to my grave.      As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,     and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her     mind that she never forgot them.      Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and	wise,  and  amid  the     flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-     gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring	as  a     violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.      Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the     fruits  of	his  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how     much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect     produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his     pious teaching and example.      Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together	in  a     bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:      The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one     to	the  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-     dered still more lovely by being together. In  the	same  way  my     dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and     cannot be separated         The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought     of the presence of God';3

'First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if youre confused about this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest that the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to Ray Tracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.      On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but thats another issue =^).  So, you get some illumination equation like this:          I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent      The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this:          I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt      That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a purple-colored glass object.      Hopefully this answers your question.  Ill forward my "illumination equation sermon" to you also.';1

'Ezek 22:26 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no difference between the holy and the profane.

I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at the burning bush when God told him "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."  These and other texts seem to imply that Gods people must treat holy things differently from other "common" things, or "make a difference" between holy and common things.  The obvious questions are   What makes something holy? and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things?

'Hi.  My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?) tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are not very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the  gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of  monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the  message-center in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, but I havent got many clues to what the english terms are, but the  brain-area is called the hypofyse in norwegian.)   My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to eat normally, my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this affect the treatment, development?  I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.  I dont intend this post to be either a flaming of the established medical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relaying events as they have happened.  Sincerely,';2
'>Subject: hate the sin...    >Date: 12 May 93 08:27:08 GMT     >"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...Ive heard that quite a bit recently,    >My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I    >would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.         If you are questioning whether or not "hating sin" is consistent with    Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:         Romans 12:9 "Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling                     to what is good."         What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is    calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would    eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to    do the opposite, to love your fellow man?     >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see    >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the    >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so    >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to    >hate the sinner.         That has not been my experience.  Ive not found myself hating anybody    as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner    myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,    since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is    able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our    very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of    the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;    BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to    love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,    while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.     >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things    >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe    >what they are doing is a sin).         The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the    Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely    pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving    for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most    loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want    to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.     >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly dont    >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and    >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build    >love.         Again, I dont think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of    the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified    in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we    can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and    they will have rejected it.         Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we    will, ourselves, be in sin.     >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our    >neighbors. He doesnt say anything about hate.         I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New    Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.     >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.         Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.     Hope this helps,    In Christ,    Tony Balsamo --';3

Fordham)        The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is  extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal  infection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted  2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed  invasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The   orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive  for HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing,  representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon  performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were  tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All  patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent   assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.   The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect  cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of  the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single  most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37  percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were  conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who  was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.   Notifying patients of the  infected surgeons HIV-status is both disruptive  and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \         =================================================================      "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV- Infected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol.   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)        The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be  quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar  investigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins  University School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a  total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical   procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was  listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for  all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were  obtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413  had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No  study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly  detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably  infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369  person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to  patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours  of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to   suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control  guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to  be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was  found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patients infection was probably  the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,   there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive  surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.        ==================================================================                                 April 20, 1993        ==================================================================  "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10   (Kolata, Gina)        A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly  unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are  undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the  Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He  said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it  had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective  in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that  HIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at  different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the  mutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one  after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies  do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new  agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data  on new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a  much more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the   collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement,  Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.   Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute  of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "Were delighted to see the   pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the  information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for  AIDS."

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on  the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of   T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should  not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877  people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving  only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the  proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to  death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The   conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected  individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the  progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study  of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already  appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the   evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has  proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV  infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the  beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of  disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself  provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes   Maddox.        ==================================================================  "Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected  Women" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe  et al.)        A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM  type in the mothers body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of  HIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized  that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the   presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in  breastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were  enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6  months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were  assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with   protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral  genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of  primers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post  partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97  percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent;  and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived  longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of  persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers milk.  The presence of HIV-1- infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of  HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.   The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM  response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in  breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers  conclude.        ==================================================================                                     April 21, 1993        ==================================================================     "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce  (04/21/93), P. 7A        A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced  Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS  research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV  infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily  from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies  since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual  AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories,  led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come  together, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies  involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche,  Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck,  Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The  participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they  were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively   involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the  collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong  scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR)  was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to  the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

'Ive read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the greater volume.

Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. PVCs are also common in runners.

'A great many computer programmers read "Dr. Dobbs Journal".  In a recent issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It    "Theres nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90s."    Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the "cracker" ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.      That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.    I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists, where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers" allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative, interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry?

'First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as  capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.    If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I  presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together.  As for the issues, lets start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact. However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  Thats my opinion, and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.  I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I  certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.    As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what youre talking about.  Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and  population control.

But there seems to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test.  I watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital.

'Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there would appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everymans right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, its interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up, some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these  groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard  was annoying.)  Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at "organized" Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a "secular" Islam - an Islam separated from its Quran, its Prophet, God, its legislation, and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslims made their anger at his book known. The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this time, already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals. The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications. At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.  Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as  this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind, has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in "boldly" defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular "heroic Knight",mounted on the his media steed,  doing battle with the "dragon" of Islamic "fundamentalism".  Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who  grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslims hold dear,  who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who, when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation, continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist. Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdies continued media mischief even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support, government support was just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making, was applied to Rushdie.   I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. "Image" is the chief concern of Muslim apologists for Islam and for Rushdie. If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good "image" (Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image). A "good image" usually means " be more like me".  Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.';0

'Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.  The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats -- again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus experiments show that LZW reliably compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that none of the FAX formats are really useful.  Whats worse, a lot of the formats arent even implemented very well, e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses bytes rather than pixels.  But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them. This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.';1

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the  application.  It may let you  - manipulate application data, the camera,   3-D objects in the scene and so on, or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects   via the widgets shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible.  For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis.

'(Deletion)   The reference to its not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms absolute, objective and others interchangeably.

Assuming that you dont intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you want to argue a point.   You have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested observer.

'This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.  1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used      to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is      misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.     Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug     therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute      it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this     distinction becomes important.  2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions impulses as a possible  	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something 	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or 	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.   	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual 	can and does suppress some of their impulses, although they 	are an unending source of anxiety.   	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with  	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to 	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

'which Kenneth Engel challenges:  I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of Jesus "paying" for our sins in the sense that many Christians accept as literal. The point is that God understands the suffering we go through, not just intellectually like when we watch the Somalians on TV, but _really_ understands, He can "feel"  our pain. This fact is manifested by Jesus life. We can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus, we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair, but the main point is that Jesus is in the trenches with us, He is in everyone, whatever I do to the least of humanity I do to Him, and whatever I do for the least of humanity I do for Him.

'I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes (type II, I guess--no insulin).    Ive been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.  Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain.   For myself, Im almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about eight small meals), the weight wont go off gradually and stay off.  Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much interest, like bread on the waters.   With this experience, its hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.  Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a balanced diet.  Its almost impossible to tell from their writings -which- parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.  Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly understood?

'It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its supporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell.  Its very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Lets now take a more complete look at scripture.  Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead."  In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a personal faith in the power of God.  Our parents faith cannot do this.  Do infants have faith?  Lets look at what the Bible has to say about it.  Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message?  Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ."  So then we receive Gods gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing Gods word preached.  Kids are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to Gods word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life.  Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."  If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesnt hold us guilty for anyone elses sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.  Ezekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted, and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!"  The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids cannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we will then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.  Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not Biblical, lets look at some of the scriptures used to support it.  Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--"  Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to each man because each man sinned.  Note that its good to read through all of Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing.  Lets look at one such.  Romans 5:19 "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous."  Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In the same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous. We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam. Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesnt all fit together.  Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."  This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after Gods own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he cant remember a time when he wasnt sinful.  He is humbling himself before God by confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isnt limited to a literal interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25). For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.  Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with other children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.  Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling is always that they dont know any better.  Lets look to see if the Bible agrees with my gut feelings.  Isaiah 7:14-15 "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right."  Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about Jesus.  If they dont, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new leader.  Jesus certainly couldnt have had less knowledge than normal human babies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they dont know to choose the right instead of the wrong.  Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with Johns baptism, not as an infant, but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was tempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).  Thank you for your attention.  Moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR  Peter Hammond is the founder of Frontline Fellowship, a missionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries in Southern Africa. He has also made several visits to many East European countries.  FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS                          ISSN 1018-144X  PRAYING FOR JUSTICE (by Peter Hammond)  To those involved in ministering to Christians suffering persecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of comfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or crime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God has entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.   THE IMPRECATORY PSALMS  Early in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for judgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them. Prayers such as: "Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for his wickedness ..." Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly motivated by love for God ("The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nation will perish from His land" 10:16, and "Why does the wicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who suffer ("You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You encourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more." 10:17-18)  Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: "Pour out your wrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them" 64:24; "O Lord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O Judge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve." 95:1-2; "Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth." 58:6-11  Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray for God to "pour out His wrath" on the wicked?  The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies. Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against His enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who "boast of evil" and "are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots destruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise deceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth." 52:1-3; "They crush your people ... They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless." 94:5- 6; "With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot against those You cherish." 83:3; "You hate all who do wrong. You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors." 5:5-6.  To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares: "Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin" 52:5; "Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who go on in their sins" 68:21.  And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: "Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ..." 59:13; "to proclaim the powers of God" 68:34; "All kings will bow down to Him and all nations will serve Him " 72:11; "Who knows the power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due You. " 90:11  Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include imprecations (prayers invoking Gods righteous judgement upon the wicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church. However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common.   PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS  Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church. I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven pray "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" Revelation 6:10).  The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino Neto. Described as a "drunken, psychotic, marxist poet", Neto had been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola. He boasted that: "Within 20 years there wont be a Bible or a church left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity." Yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto. Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in Moscow.  In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:   *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be      arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.   *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles      in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be      turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in      fact carried out. But the next day when the official was      medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal      cancer. He died shortly afterwards.   *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a      Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car      crash the very next day.   *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on      the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to      carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted      gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,      the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to      dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded      with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would      not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against      Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building      was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.      "They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord      Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the      Lord spread widely and grew in power. " Acts 19:17,20  Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of "the antiChrist is dead" in the streets. Many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of Romania.  Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora Machel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the 1960s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly Marxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in Mozambique were closed confiscated, "nationalised" chained and padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled, some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians, including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to concentration camps - most were never seen again.  A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him (Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in Mozambique, Machels Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africas boundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and published. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor, but He had also saved a country from persecution.  In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27 year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on 31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian country.  It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots, declared trembling and in tears: "I am more afraid of John Knoxs prayers than of an army of ten thousand".  On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa this Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.  The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people were murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other victims. Indeed the SA government, the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were unbanned!  Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973, Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANCs "military wing" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: "all who live by the sword will die by the sword " Matt 26:52.  After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly declared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during "the struggle") I told him that I was a Christian and, while I didnt hate him, I did hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God would remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist.  Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani to repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against unrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer, within months of these public prayers for God to stop these killers of preborn babies.  Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted: "When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers " Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any - even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory prayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did our Lord (Matt 11:20-24).  What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be? Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, "War Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory Psalms" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company):  Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly in teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the Old Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT are from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50 times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.   1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?  Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as "devilish", "diabolical ", "unsuited to the church", and "Not God s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus teaching that we should love our enemies. "  Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares: "All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. " (see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).  The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of God.  Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God have led many to become "evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to "clean up" Gods Word according to their own ideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for His Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the authority of Gods Word (like Eves original sin of listening to Satans question "Yes, hath God said... ?").  The Psalms are part of Gods revelation of Himself and His attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the authoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as "unsuited" and "unworthy" for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about Himself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles used as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb 4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.  CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially Ps 109): "Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would speak to us therein. "  The rejection of any part of Gods Word is a rejection of the giver of that Word, God Himself.   2. Who is praying these Psalms?  Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually spoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at the Last Supper.  On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient authority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own words - the words of the Lords Anointed - which as Davids Son He truly was. "Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit" Ps 31:5 "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" Ps 22:1  In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on the day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so! Matt 7:23 "Then I will tell them plainly, I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers. " Ps 6:8  In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said these words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22 directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having spoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed Christ is speaking in the Psalms.  Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in all the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again to execute Judgement on the wicked. David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a prototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30: "being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ. " David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in his words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah spoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by Christ. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His forerunner David.  The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of God, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion for the wronged.   3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?  Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with the sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for which He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the substitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah 53).  "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. " 2 Cor 5:21  In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others. All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the imprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy His enemies.  These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of King Jesus. His prayers will be answered! Gods Word is revealed upon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects Gods way of forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses of God.  He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a reality when He declares to those on His left: "Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. " Matt 25:41  All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *Gods Kingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone will reign forever! "With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. " Rev 19 : 15   4. Are Jesus prayers contradictory?  What about Jesus command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us (Matt 5:44)?  Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives sin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement on those who disobey His Gospel.  "God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed. " 2 Thess 1:6-10  Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on earth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot God.  Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations. "Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? " Matt 23  In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His betrayal by Judas.  We also need to acknowledge that Christs prayers of blessing are not for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only praying to the elect of God - those who have: "obeyed your Word"... "accepted" Gods Word ... and have "believed ". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the message of Gods kingdom will be judged.)   5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?  Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: "Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done " then "he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say: Curses, maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground . "  To pray tor the extension of Gods kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: "The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. "  * Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness. *  There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church cannot exclude hatred tor satans kingdom from its love for Gods kingdom. Gods kingdom cannot come without satans kingdom being destroyed. Gods will cannot be done on earth without the destruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of evil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.  Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who "plot together" against God and His people: "Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O Lord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground. "  The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5) provides a vivid example of Gods judgement on the wicked. Sisera "cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years" and they "cried to the Lord for help" Judges 4:3. In response to those prayers: "The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot... All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. " Judges 4:15-16  The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of the head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. "As you did to Sisera ..."   6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience  The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:      "If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,      which are written in this book, and do not revere this      glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord      will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He      will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you      dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also      bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not      recorded in this Book of the Law until you are      destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...      so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be      uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. "      Deuteronomy 28:58-63  The covenant God made with His people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27 records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account: "The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice: "Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing detestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsmans hands - and sets it up in secret. " Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " "Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother... "Cursed is the man who moves his neighbours boundary stone... "Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads... "Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow... "Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly... "Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. "Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by carrying them out. Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " Deut 27:14-26  The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting Christ is the curse. "If anyone does not love the Lord - a curse be on him. " 1 Corinthians 16:22  (See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26- 31; 12:14-29.)   7. How can we preach these prayers?  The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders. Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander- in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we expect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not hear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him onto the battlefield?  Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Churchs Commander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the generals orders. The pastors charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army. Theres no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesnt agree with his Commanders strategy.  When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching mission, He told them to proclaim the coming of Gods Kingdom (Lk 10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to Gods rule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we must consider what He said they should do if their message were rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against Gods rule - "But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near" Luke 10:11.  What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that town (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message (verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great authority He had given them: "He who listens to you listens to Me; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects him who sent Me " (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor calling down Gods curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion against Gods authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of His servants.  We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the Prince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable.  Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is that God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he reap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings 6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant breakers is real.  The "I" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The "we" of the Psalms includes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our own, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record Christs march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As Christ is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will answer the psalmists prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the final day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when He will say: "But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me" Luke 19:27.  A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that Gods kingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of God, including "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God " Eph 6:17. That battle- readiness also involves "pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.  Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of God as the psalmist did: "Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not call on Your Name" Ps 79:6.  To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for Gods justice. Those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers.  "Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against them. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. " Ps 149:5-9  Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army of God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He has given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people nf God to destroy evil.  If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or undermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword anew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of Jesus - until "the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea" Hab 2:14.

'Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies  falsely, it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely to prophecy truely again.  Take, for example the story in Kings about the man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king. The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home. Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house, so he prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his  house.  While they ate and drank in his house, the Lord gave the prophet who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of the Lord.  It came to pass.';3

'Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when theyre used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if theyre used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.  Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning.';2

'Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes control their dreams.  For example, I might decide before going to sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often (not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.  I guess I think that the same standards apply in these "directed" dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing adultary).  When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my "inner life" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause needs to be resolved.    In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I dont often remember dreams that I dont chose to have.  When I do, they almost always tell me something important. I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour (in fact Ive had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can remember, and it was definately spiritually important) I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and white.  Interesting topic - Ill be fascinated to read other responses.  Alison';3
'What is wrong with "the Spirit talking to Himself."  Jesus intercedes for us, and Romans 8:26-27 tell of how the Spirit intercedes for us before God.  That is no theological problem.  Tounges as a prayer language finds support in I Corinthians 14:14-18.    Its true that this could be (and has been) used as a rug to sweep any difficulties under.  But it is a valid point.  Paul does mention angelic tounges in the verse.     If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel, then it stands to reason that angels would speak a different language from us.  You do  have a valid point about multiple angelic languages.  But angelic beings maybe of different species so to speak.  maybe different species communicate differently.     I have heard an eyewitness account, myself.  Such things are hard to prove. They dont lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well.  I don;t know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway.   Thats an unprovable statement.  How can you prove if somethings been proved? There is no way to know that youve seen all the evidence.

'That was my point. If I play poker with Monopoly money I can bet  anything I want.   This is exactly why Christianity is missionary in nature, not just out of a need to irritate. 8-)    To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written, there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This is a poor answer which you neednt rebut.  I will now pull the old bait and switch.  I think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God. By that I mean, if your moral intuition doesnt like what is described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on now. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil and ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically, but everyone, including myself. If I dont like the genocide in the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now? To move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people right now are suffering. If you think hell isnt fair and are willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence, what about how life isnt fair? Right now there is a young mother with three little kids who doesnt know how she will get through the day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie. Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to fix his TV. Instead of why doesnt God help them ask why dont we help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian who doesnt live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.  You want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference, someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times and has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask  the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the  woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful business woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound baby. They wont all be Christians, or even what you might call religious, but there will be something in common.  God is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is in those peoples hearts. It doesnt matter if you cant give intellectual assent to any description youve heard, theyre all wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart  is a step in the right direction. Follow that instead. Then come back and read the Bible and youll see that same thing described there.   Good, I guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8-)';3

I dont agree with it; now try proving, through #>#some objective moral test, that my disagreeing is incorrect. =) #>  #> Your claim, which you have deleted now was "not universal => not objective". # #      Ive deleted it now, in the interest of brevity. Go back a step #and youll see it was still in your post. Yes, that was my claim; if you #can refute it, then please do so.  Firstly, an apology.  You hadnt deleted your claim, and I was mistaken in saying you had. Sorry for any offence caused.  Secondly,  how can I refute your definition?  I can only point up its logical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word "objective" in other areas.  Indeed, by your definition, an objective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that belief, other than that it is useless, and that "objective" is a perfectly good word.  #> So, what *is* objective?  Not the age of the universe, anyway, as I show #> above. # #      How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self- #consistent? Id be amazed if it was more than one. How many different #moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single #individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?  Begging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are saying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about it.  Why?  #      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be #emirically verified through means thatll give the same result no matter #who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the #largish side...).   This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality which doesnt depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rats ass about the means of which you speak?  #Ive heard of no way to verify morality in a #consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to #enlighten me?  The same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value. If a moral system makes a prediction "It will be better if...", that can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction "This drug will relieve pain..."  #      Peoples *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective; #you can have any idea you like, and I cant stop you. Universae and #their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are, and if you #dislike some detail of them, thats a problem with your *opinion* of #them.   Sure.  Assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.  #I claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such #subjective and individual. If Im wrong, then some more-or-less #objectively "real" thing exists, which you label "objective morality"; #can you back up this positive claim of existence?  Can you back up your positive claim above?  No.  Thats because its an assumption.  I make the same assumption about values, on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same.  #>#      Point: Morals are, in essence, personal opinions. Usually #>#(ideally) well-founded, motivated such, but nonetheless personal. The #>#fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question, #>#sometimes even for the same reason, does not make morals objective; it #>#makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question, #>#which can be good for the evolution of a social species. #>  #> And if a "real large lot" (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a  #> football on a desk, Im supposed to see a logical difference between the two?   #> Perhaps you can explain the difference to me, since you seem to see it #> so clearly. # #      Take a look on the desk - i.e., perform a test.

'Well I agree with you in the sense that they have no "moral" right to inflict these rules, but there is one thing I might add: at the very least, almost everybody wants to avoid pain, and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a herd morality, then so be it.

'This is not at all comparable. Christianity is the main stream in western culture. You are trivializing the experiences of others.  I remember what it was like being "different" as a Christian. We were told all the time that we were different, and in fact that only members of the our church were really Christians (though others who believed in God werent as bad as atheists), so we were a small minority. That was nothing compared to being an atheist.  The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian being surrounded by staunch atheists, including parents, who actively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishments and, even worse, emotional blackmail. They would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their side. Maybe these conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in a country with "under God" in its pledge of allegiance.  * I doubt it even then, because children have to be taught to be Christians and hence must have support somewhere.   Yes. My atheism was "born of necessity." For an intellectually honest person belief is mostly a response to evidence. Will or wishes have nothing to do with it. I could choose to lie, or to be silent about my true beliefs. I could no more choose to believe in the God of Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to me. Still I should be clear that Im not equating what I went through with what gays go through. However it is a mistake to assume that everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them. Happily some are made stronger, once we get past it.   Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my childhood friends. Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally, and a repressive upbringing can leave its scars even, or especially, on those who dont get free of it. I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and I feel no need to defend it.  By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet.

'While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma to the point of misrepresentation.  There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus, Jains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.)  To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions.  Karma is considered to be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape a persons predilections for future intention and action and produce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite -- "reward" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact "As you sow, so shall you reap" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor of natural growth is explicit.  Hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being theistically inclined.  In point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia considers karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics of karma without the element of free will.  Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and rebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.  Isnt Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation among Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them to the Christian scriptures?';3
'[...etc...]   I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Pauls illustration about one body / many parts far too narrowly. It is easy to say that the one body represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for that. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide variety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox, etc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the context of the body of Christ. And I am equally sure that one day, after we shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly but see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things we held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are called, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone else is called.  One of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - cant recall the name) put it quite succiently:  	In essentials, unity. 	In nonessentials, liberty. 	In all things, charity.  While I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian implies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean anything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit too broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those bounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together.   Me? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an inerrantist, though Ill grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately pre-mill, and evangelical. But, Im not ready to damn those who use icons, say mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really dont believe that she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for salvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth - why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth? But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word, and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                       --T.S.

'> I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in  > Heaven knowing that even one man would spend his "eternal life"  > being scorched for his wrongdoings....  Stephen, I suspect that when you and I use the word "Hell," we have different concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do not suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the concept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that about the "fires" of Hell?      Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the last description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the Ferris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant by Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this connection, there are two reasons that occur to me.      The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart -- but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS SHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with matches).      The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word "Gehenna," one of the words translated "Hell" in the New Testament. It refers to the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive) to Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem. "To be cast into Gehenna" or "to burn in Gehenna" thus became a metaphor for "to be rejected or discarded as worthless."  Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart is my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT DIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no flames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most bookstores and libraries.';3

':Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver :biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months :after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have :persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests.

The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with :CAH needs to be treated.  I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems that indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral, drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of "thresholds" for electing to biopsy someones liver.  Personally, I think that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thus providing these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see if anyones done any decision analysis on this.';2

'Some of the MDs in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good (maybe in some cases with good reason).  In this post on depression, Im  laying it all out.  Ill continue to post here because I think that I have  some knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you  should know where Im coming from when I post again in the future.    Lida, I can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from  bouts of depression.  Hers was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a  rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and  chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through  her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When  severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to  use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS using  supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet  in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didnt work and  she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after  by wifes breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and  one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another  stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with  supplementation.  Didnt work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac.  I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using  B6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  Im not going to do that  because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.  Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the  problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use  an approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly  what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be  affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these  stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was  pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is  a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your  bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C),  you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any  nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from  being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase  your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become  very important.  Lida, without your permission, Im going to use your post as a conduit to  try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where Im coming  from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic  Medical schools for ten years now.  Ive written my own textbook because  none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I  preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by  my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:  Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids  Proteins I					Proteins II  Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional 						Status I, A Clinical  						Perspective  Evaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional		 A Biochemical Perspective			Status III, Homework  						Assignment Using the  						Nutritionist IV Diet and  						Fitness Analysis Software  						program  Weight Control					Food Fads and Facts  Age-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements	Food Additives,  						Contaminants and Cancer  Drug-Nutrient Interactions			Mineral and Water Balance  Sodium, Potassium and Chloride			Calcium, Magnesium and  						Phosphorus  Iron						Zinc and Copper  Iodine and Fluoride				Other Trace Minerals  Vitamin A					Vitamin E  Vitamins D and K				Vitamin C  Thiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine  Pantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12  Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition  Parenteral Nutrition  Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature  to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this  in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down  and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books  that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which  I write myself) Ive pulled figures, tables and graphs from various  copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for  educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not  send this material out to newsgroup readers(as Ive been asked to do).  I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition  assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need  to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the  nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to  be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to  design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment  Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with  hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a  nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin  Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup.  For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new  Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I  have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown  series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more  to residency training.  Two M.Ds have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it  does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a  patients nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the  Preface of this new text:  "So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists,  hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge  of nutrition as it related to their field of practice."    "Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United  States require no formal instruction in nutrition."  "But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the  leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related."  "... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it  should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of  nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your  awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important  for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially  every organ system."  Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH   Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find  a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals (yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and  who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when  women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are  occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A  nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned  that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red  cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium  reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to  try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are  also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral  analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using  certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some  pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone  who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are  using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory  Improvement Act).    A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown  to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging  and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But  there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not  show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status. Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the  U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional  profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses  diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue  to be the best approach to depression.

'Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we can ask: 1. Is it authoritative? 2. Is it prophetic? 3. Is it authentic? 4. Is it dynamic? 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?  On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. To quote Ungers Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture. 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling.   But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and it wasnt until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didnt accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest, and it was literally over his dead body that it was included in the catholic canon.   How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.  It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus attitude. He had no argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus  that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the  OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.   I am not familiar with the book.  Some other arguments you might like to consider are found in Chapter 3 of Josh McDowells Evidence That Demands A Verdict.';3

'I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe because the person who prescribed it didnt know much and gave up after a 20mg dose didnt work.  Now Im seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some.  Now Im trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem Im having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.  My psychiatrists strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs dont work at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.   Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs dont have much experience in this area, and from what Ive seen Im inclined to believe him.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my family practitioners office.

'Im asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that Ive encountered in 2 different PEX implementations.  I cant find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskinss _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors documentation).  Im posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this, its a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, its worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  Its as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through" areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  Ive observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1.  Open questions:     (1) Why does this happen?         --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?         --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which             could be corrected for?         --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their             interpolators?         --  Something else?     (2) What to do about it?         --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in Z-buffered HLHSR?         --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching             artifacts?         --  Am I just out of luck?

'EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove  calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such  use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung  disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also  binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when  EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that  were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove  calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C  and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra  vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium  from the plaques).  The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably  can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns  with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.  	1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review" 	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).

'Note:  I am breaking this reply into 2 parts due to length.   I agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights  activists.  But if there are zero verses that "clearly address the issues,"  doesnt that mean that there are also no verses that clearly *support* your  case?  Are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly  address the issues?   The story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity  to "know" the two men who were Lots guests; the fact that the Sodomites became  angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they  were interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was  rape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some  Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as  sinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it  was that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended  rape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible  alternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those  who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying  to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.  You seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the  fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to  "stigmatize" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can  see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion  that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again were not  supposed to start from our conclusions because thats circular reasoning.  If  God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more  probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites  blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I  will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises  *any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.   The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church  as the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be  legitimate, and thus the churchs refusal to recognize "perverted" marriages  was circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the  church ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a  straw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise  definition/translation of "porneia" isnt really important, unless you are  trying to argue that the Bible doesnt really condemn extramarital sex.  Im  not sure the moderator was trying to do that.  In any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.   When Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, "Have you not read, that He who  created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this  cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and  the two shall become one flesh?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one  flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." (Mt.  19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife  (female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of  heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men,  and not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this  union, in Jesus words, because it is not something created by men.  This is not circular reasoning, this is just reading Gods word.  I read in the  Bible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any  similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there  have been uninspired men who have ordained "alternative" unions (isnt Caligula  reported to have "married" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to  as "what God has joined together" is the heterosexual union of a man and his  wife.  (Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know thats probably inflammatory, and I  should save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.   Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of  my reply.)  Anyway, my original question was not whether we should translate "porneia" in a  way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was:  given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as  divinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of  marriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we  need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You  seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and  other sins) are really wrong:   Alternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as "porneia" and all  the rest was, in Pauls day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the  "tutor" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen  centuries drumming into the heads of Gods people the idea that things like  homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.   Perhaps Paul didnt go into detail on what "porneia" &c were because after 1600  years he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the  reason Gods apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining  a distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any  significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.   Ill discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just  wanted to point out that the New Testaments failure to develop a detailed new  standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about  sexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for  practicing homosexuality!   And how do you define an "obsessively driven" mode of sexual behavior?  How do  you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex  drives?  Is the desire to have "sinful" sex an obsessively driven mode of  behavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined  as sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that  the person is driven to seek it even though its sinful.  Or is it obsessive  because it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, thats  circular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even  though society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is  obsessive.  You seem to be trying to limit the Bibles condemnation of "porneia" to only  "perverted" sex acts, but I dont think you can really define "perverted"  without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What,  then, is Paul condemning when he declares that "Fornicators...shall not enter  the kindgom of heaven"?   I think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some  technical definition of "porneia", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness  of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual  counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.   Please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part  2.   I am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual  intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this  would show that Gods condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual  law?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual  behavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that  Gods definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to  just the ritual law and those who are under the Law?  Ive been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the  subject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping  requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to  rest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on  the Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements  such as "Thou shalt not kill", and requirements that are merely part of the  (temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.  The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of  homosexual intercourse as "an abomination" is *just* a part of the temporary,  Jews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by  God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those  guilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Heres why:  Back in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in  the possession of "the Amorite"--kinda hard on the Amorite, dont you think?   But in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:   it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because "the  iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete".  Remember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the  iniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his  being cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18  again.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest,  homosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, "Do  not defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the  nations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the  land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so  the land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these  abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their  people."  Notice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of  Moses) are about to be punished because they have "defiled" themselves and  their land by committing "abominations" that include incest, bestiality, and  homosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these  same "abominations" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on  anyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man "lying  with another man as one lies with a woman" (Lv. 20:13).  Their  "bloodguiltiness" was upon them, meaning that in Gods eyes, they deserved to  die for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even "the alien  [non-Jew] who sojourns among you" was to refrain from these practices, on  penalty of being "cut off [by God?] from among their people."  Under the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the  claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not  the homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list  sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the  Canaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay  sex), Id say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even  by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.   According to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable  for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I  believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can  learn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is  a violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law  (for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain  actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I  conclude that Gods objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a  person is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case  of homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling  abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the  Law as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that  Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply  saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not  obligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to  our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has  declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.

'(WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLED   Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think.   The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was  also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could  not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be  able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing  weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead,  they expected him to die at sea.   Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles,  making the trip practical.   Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earths circumference is  indeed 25K miles.   Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right  about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.    My source is the recent PBS series on Columbus.  )';2
': I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where : Christians were called to "repent" of Americas "national" sins, such : as sexual promiscuity. :  : To which I reply: ...whoa there! :  : How can I repent of _someone elses_ sin?   I cant. :  : And when I claim to "repent" of someone elses sin, am I not in fact : _judging_ him?  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us : not to judge people. "Judge not that ye be not judged." :  : C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II, : when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging "national repentance" : for the horrors (sins???) of World War II. : --   I see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.  To repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly arrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed us the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other nations.  Weve slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have stricken the name of God from the classroom.  Weve cheated God out of the honor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public as our sins have been.  When Jesus said "Judge not that ye be not judged", he was not addressing those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to repent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down condemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brothers.  But He also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Dont forget that this is a command too.  Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the excuse that we dont want to judge anyone.  In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin what it is and do so openly.  Let its charge fall correctly where it should. But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their hellward path and onto the heavenward path.  -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 	"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

'I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that will do compositing of a series of pictures?  What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do manual compositing also.  Its ok if I have to composite one frame at a time; I assumed Id have to do that anyway.  But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better.';1

'No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.    The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum. The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong. It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on  yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees, and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.    I talked to one of the nurses in my doctors office recently about this, and she said she didnt like them either, for same reasons.  She did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on ones self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Drs office.  I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect that many people dont realize this, and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason.';2

'There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to "spot reduce" body fat other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat", so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat" is "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate, and one does not ever "change into" the other.';2

Despite its small size and quickness,   it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:   standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,   mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or   different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each   graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually   infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are   almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four   different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and   other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.   Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),   including a portable metafile format and renderer.      Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on   hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot      At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:      Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix   Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT      Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The programs quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose."    "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesnt have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software."    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files cant be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.   Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical   image community. They issue a newsletter also.   They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last   I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.    Its suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.   Very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of   documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.  ALV ---   A Sun-specific image toolkit.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) Its written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmers environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isnt that   difficult to write your own with their programmers module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratorys Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through.

'The bacteria in your gut are important.  But colonic flushes are not the  way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of  bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of  antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in  your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real  problem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment  is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments". Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and Ive  picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his  instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is  also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and  disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than  the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much  higher fees do not drive away patients.  I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to  this colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you  subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV. Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment? Could they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a  pathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not  cleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk? Food for thought.';2
'There are exactly ZERO verses that "clearly" address the issues.   The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.   The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or "reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions, with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated Christian discussion of ALL these areas.  Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly "harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]  	"I am free to do anything, you say.  Yes, but not everything 	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one 	will not let anything make free with me."  [1 Cor. 6:12]  Which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God.  A commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so its a secondary argument from the phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of Gods messengers.  I wont deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially. Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and which ones are "ritual."  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus from the "ritual law" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.  Im dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this matter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part of the ritual law?  For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can be "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to determine why you "pick" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: "No doubt I am free to do anything." But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this, the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this context, it is remarkably offensive to say:   Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality.  It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so.  Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.  Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is.  Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ. WHY, for Gods precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you dont know and wont even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor? God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.  Why, for Gods sake?  	"For God did not send the Son into the world 	to condemn the world, 	but that the world might be saved through him. 	Whoever believes in him is not condemned, 	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned 	for refusing to believe in the name of Gods only Son. 	Now the judgment is this: 	the light has come into the world, 	but men have preferred darkness to light 	because their deeds were evil. 	For everyone who practices wickedness 	hates the light, 	and does not come near the light 	for fear his deeds will be exposed. 	But he who acts in truth 	comes into the light, 	so that it may be sh0own 	that his deeds are done in God."	John 3:17-21  For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of Gods light.  Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.  However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us.';3

'[ ... my stuff deleted ... ]   Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesnt.  This board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters experiences regarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to share resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come here to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism.     If you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The phrase "deliberately mistaken" is rather oxymoronic.     The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names of some analagous Islamic groups?)    When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her Christianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread enough, it can change societies.  The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.';0

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epsons. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that dont have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, theres a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: 	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd., 	00196 Rome Italy, 	Piazzale Flaminio, 19 	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you cant be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  Theres a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in   "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  "Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan 87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newells teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep 87 in Jim Blinns column "Jim Blinns Corner" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so youre advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Heres a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the models distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isnt normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanfords InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  Im not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraws binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgifs sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. ice requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.Its a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and its available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and its an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  Its a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages Ive heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  Im not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  Ive   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  Thats a   freebie if you want it"    "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if its not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, its mostly astronomical   image processing which Ive been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.    FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.   iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization)       /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI    Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because its public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERLs Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI   database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and   God only knows what all else -- theres a LOT.  I dont have and dont   use these, so cant say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from   a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default   directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  Theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different   "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industrys "CT2T" format, would probably (I havent tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOURE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  Its worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to   contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI "database").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"   in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesnt suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  Its   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if youre interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

'I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that    will do compositing of a series of pictures?     What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip    (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated    bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of    pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want    the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this    with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do    manual compositing also.  Its ok if I have to composite one frame at    a time; I assumed Id have to do that anyway.  But being able to    composite a series of frames would be even better.     Ive looked around and I havent found a PC package that will perform    this.  Help, please!  If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do this for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color "clear", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a way right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animator will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work.';1

': I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Now, how is it such a grave : mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons?  Or are you claiming that we shouldnt : sell any weapons to other countries?  Straightforward answer please.  Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering in the politcs of newly renunified Yemen, including assasinations and  border incursions. It is entirely possible that they will soon invade. Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put aside political differences during reunification and thus the West has effectively lost one half (North?) as a client state.';0

'For your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of Christ) I quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern (Chalcedonian) and Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox scholars a few years ago (Both families = both Orthodox churches) :  1. Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families confess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten of the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and was born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect man with soul, body and mind  ($  \nu o  \upsilon \zeta $); He  was crucified, died, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the Heavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all creation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the Church as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His glory, according to the Scriptures.  2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of Theodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that Christ is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and by nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature God,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.  3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by uniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which He has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature, which He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will and energy.  4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ are united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ without  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ thought alone. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^  5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis of the Logos Incarnate.  [...]  I guess that adresses your question adequately.  As for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the discussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an endless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief answer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church  regarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc. is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.

'The principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in psychology called entrainment, whereby external sensory stimuli influence gross electrical patterns of brain function.  They are experimental in that people experiment with them and they are _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.   Given the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electrical  stimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine.  They are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical  category to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the FDA does not  specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.      There are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects for mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with  meditation or self-hypnosis as well.  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and subjective so far, so its hard to generalize about their potential value.  A pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety of these devices may be found in "Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman ?" Some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews of specific equipment.     A more important question might be whether they have enough additional value to be worth investing in.  Biofeedback was found to be a legitimate and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in that it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously  considered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable  therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and temporary nature of the effects in most cases.   Maybe someone else  has more, there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines, somewhere on the net.   						kind regards,';2
': Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the : standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we : can ask: : 1. Is it authoritative?  "Authoritative" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative.  : 2. Is it prophetic?  How is "prophecy" to be defined? If it is "speaking forth" of Gods message, much of the apocrypha must surely qualify.  : 3. Is it authentic?  Again, by what standard?  Is "authenticity" a function of the authors? the historical accuracy?   : 4. Is it dynamic?  What is this supposed to mean?  Many of the apocryphal books are highly "dynamic" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting.  : 5. Is it received, collected, read and used?  By whom?  Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some), collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are, in the Catholic and Orthodox churches).  : On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.  This is demonstrably false.  : To quote Ungers Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: : 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and : anachronisms.  So do other books of the Bible.  : 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices : which are at variance with sacred Scripture.  "False" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no contradiction with the rest of scripture.    : 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of : subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.  This is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures. (In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal "Additions to the Book of Esther" act rather to bring the "unscripturelike" book of Esther more into line with other books.)  : 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine : Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and : poetic and religious feeling.  Have you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They exhibit every bit as much "poetic and religious feeling" as Psalms or Proverbs.  [deletions]  : How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who  hears the : words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to : them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. : And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will : take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the : holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) : Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.  These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone, not to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very late into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.  : It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus attitude. He had no : argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John : 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus  : that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the  : OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 : taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say : Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.  Jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day, the canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books of the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of the early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e. The Torah (Pentateuch/ "Law") was established in Jesus day, as were the Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however, were still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the Psalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.  To argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51 is weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological story.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the present order) did not exist as such in Jesus day.';3

'Though you can certaily assert all this, I dont see why it necessarily has to be the case. Why cant hate just stay as it is, and not beget more? Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily so.  Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?   Certainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil and love the good. This cant contradict Christs teaching. I think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be considered more objectively. Surely I dont fly into a rage at every sin I see, but why can I not "hate" it?';3
'"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...Ive heard that quite a bit recently,  often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality... but the context really isnt that important. My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. Ill leave it unnamed since I dont want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not  something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the  stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so  strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and  do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even  believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly dont love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build love.  In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our  neighbors. He doesnt say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he  commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love  with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to love someone is to pray for them.   - Scott';3
'The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus words seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection. This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other- wise, why would Jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as a contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall, and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least, thats what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of  marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)';3

'Hello. I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country.  I am not sure if it is going on also here in the US or any other country.  In all these 4 1/2 yrs. Ive been here in Illinois, USA, I have not encountered it.  May I just call it "Traveling Fatima" since I dont know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language.  For certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/ statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home (originating from owner) to another.  This will stay with that family for one (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Lady of Fatima.  The move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current home after departing prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move.  There will be the receiving prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image there.  It does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image.  They may invite others (or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participate during prayer time in that new home everyday for one week. This image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district, until it goes back to the owner of the image.  This is probably going on around there (Philippines) right now (or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot) and every year, this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima.  It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image then is just moved next door.  I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives.  Most of our friends and neighbors there are Catholics and practicing ones.  Id like to know if there are any state/community laws that this  practice will violate, whatsoever, before I go for it.  Thank you  for any comments or help about this matter.';3

The point is, #there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.  No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isnt implied by what you say before, because youre trying to sneak in "innate features of [all] theism".  The word youre groping for is "some".  #Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.  No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism, since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed to the case you are trying to make?  #And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw #men.

'Dear fellow Christians,    	I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which       I am in. We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity and Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, "What??" I did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are so kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them (in my point of view, they dont sin as much as I do). How come if they were under Satan, they could have such personalities.   To tell you the truth, I dont know much about Islam. But I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of judgement. 	 	Now Im  asking you what your opinions about Islam and  its teaching.   IMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not. 	    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.  P.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,      and bit.listserv.catholic.   In Christ, our Lord,                           Smile......... 					       Jesus loves you....... 	Tabut Torsina 	TORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU	     [Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of Islam, since theres a group for that.  But I suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam. Indeed its going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians are saved is at the heart of it.  The classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until the last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism) was the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions worshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and possibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that theres no truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are intentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare, Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ. If this is the background of your teachers remarks -- and I suspect it is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily relevant.  The point is not that theres anything intrinsically wrong with it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners may all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a follower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.  This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position. Christianity says that salvation isnt a matter of being kind and nice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no one is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ. (Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  Theres a Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in different terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways.  But if it doesnt have Christ, its like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying.  Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position. What Im trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other religions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move within Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental God.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.';3

'These are MY last words on the subject     Some people think it enhances the flavor.  I personally dont think it helps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it.    Well, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff.    EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!  Why cant people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  Ive gotten LOTS of recipes off the net that dont use additives.  If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!!   I dont!!   HEY - Ill pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does NOT have preservatives.  I choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways.    Nacho cheese Doritos, breading for MANY frozen fried foods (like fish and chicken), etc. ad naseum.   Or the "and other natural flavorings syndrome."  Its been a few years since Ive bought anything labelled with "and other natural flavorings".      Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess whats in there - reaction to Lawrys season salt - guess whats in THERE  Ill give you a hint - Ive had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.  UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I wont eat the stuff without my Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.   Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY its enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didnt flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when theres waste - but it was a simple explanation - I wont eat this stuff, I WONT cook with this stuff, so I can either throw it out or give it away.)    Probably Lawrys seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.    Im not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  Ive noticed that I have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the Chinese restaurants the day before.      But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - some say its more like 20% - but lets say that its 5%.  How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldnt VOLUNTEER for a test. Like thanks guys but I dont WANT to get sick.  Also - Im sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times.  If I have a cold Im MUCH more susceptible to the reaction than when Im healthy (as proven today - when Im stuffy but for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ chips ;}).    Cathy doesnt - I havent saved all my postings but I NEVER called it "chinese restaurant syndrome" and I NEVER stated I got it only from Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or not hold) the MSG.  I cant call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them to make me ONE back of chips without MSG.   Well, I believe I mentioned that in an earlier post   Lets see you wrote this message at  Date: 20 Apr 1993 00:09:31 -0500  but on   Date: 19 Apr 1993 16:33:18 GMT     OH - and just in case anyone thinks Im prejudice against either Chinese food or Asian people - Im not going home to cook some Chinese food for the guy Im marrying next week.

Andrew Byler)  1] A english translation of this can be found in:    "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an    introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson    (London, 1923).  2] Another work that might be useful is:    "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and    Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;    reprinted 1970).  (This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I dont know if it actually contains an english translation or not.)  3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:    "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in    Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).  4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early 80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyones interested.)  5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if youre interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:    "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible    Society, 1971).  Metzgers book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).     "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full    report (with an English translation) of the several additions and    other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...    Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the    text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the    evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).   6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).  7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clarks edition (mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.  8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.  9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.';3

'Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems:  First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it, the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular, if Im not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food, food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying, and causes frequent discomfort.  My doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so, was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this, especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation, reaction to anesthesia).  The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVCs in 24 hrs, along with a few PACs. (Many days, there are far more than this, however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesnt feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or caffeine, etc. Im willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but dont want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number of PVCs seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the same time.  Thanks for any help/advice!';2

'What we call today the "Old Testament" was being written up to approx- imately 168 BCE, according to most modern scholars.  Aside from the book of Daniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written (predominantly) in Hebrew. 	There were also other books being written at about this time and later by Greek-speaking, or "Hellenistic", Jews.  These books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as "Apocrypha". 	Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today called the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However, there were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased. This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from God. 	By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians had come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in synagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders got together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach) onward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In particular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were not inspired. 	At about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi- astes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those which had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben Sira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian and Hellenistic writings. 	Jerome excluded the apocrypha because they were not in use by Jews of his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his time.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings was not based on inspiration.';3

'continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission,  THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY                                        James B. DeYoung  W. Petersen       More recently Wrights understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic confusion in using the English word "homosexuals" as the meaning of arsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for rendering it by "homosexuals" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.       In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds "homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  "A major disjunction" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in Pauls time (187-88).        What is this "disjunction"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic facts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts.  Virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable.  Christianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" in describing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of "homosexuals" and "heterosexuals," and assumed that, in the words of Dover quoted approvingly by Petersen, "everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ." (188). [23]        In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term "homosexual" to desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term equivalent to "homosexual," used it as referring to orientation, impluse or affectional preference and having "nothing to do with sexual acts" (189).       Petersen then proceeds to cite the "Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary,"  which defines "homosexual" only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts.  Petersens point is that by using "homosexuals" for arsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history "where no equivalent concept existed" (189).  Consequently the translation is inaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes female homosexuals" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no "cognitive structure, either inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence" (189).       The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio "homosexual" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one mistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next phases of this paper will critically examine Petersens position.                          THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING                           ARSENOKOITAI BY "HOMOSEXUALS"  Historical Grounds       A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Pauls usage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to present-day concepts.         Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual condition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be part of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes;  Scroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under "Linguistic Grounds."       In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the homosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if it is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including ancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it.  Indeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of same-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex orientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in "Symposium" (189d-192d) may be a "sole possible exception" to ancient ingnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even here "acts appear to be the deciding factor."  However, this is a very significant exception, hardly worthy of being called "an exception," because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.       THe "Symposium" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman"). Hence "original nature" palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these human beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:      Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like     a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever     searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections     of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are      woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,     whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.     All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:     they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.     Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as      their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by     making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be     clasped in mens embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,     for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless     creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness     but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome     their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity     these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come     to mans estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in     wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of     custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.     A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the      willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when     one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort-      happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously      thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be      induced to leave each others side for a single moment.  These are     they who continue together throughout life, though they could not     even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]  Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each "would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time:  (192e).       Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is contemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  "Natural interest" (ton noun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination.  The words, "born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man:  (paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims "to be born this," i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity ("the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love," 192b) is present.  Aristophanes even speaks of "mutual love ingrained in mankind reassembling our early estate" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency ("These are they who continue together throughout life," 102c) is also present.  Further mention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, "gay pride," pederasty, homophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is recognizable.      Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from actions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b).  They mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow kinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion" (186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or "matters" of love (187c), the desires of love (192c) and being "males by nature" (193c).  Noteworthy is the speech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for "what is not provided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack."  This is the object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between "what sort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e).  This ancient philosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]       In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not inclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter. [27]       Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In Rom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desires of the heart." and "reprobate mind" prove Pauls concern for disposition and inclination along with the "doing" or "working" of evil (also see vv. 29-32).  Even the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor 6:9-11) by words describing what people "are" or "were," not what they "do."  Habits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt. 23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise to the other (cf. Mt 5:27).       Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian, people of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a few moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example, Seneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women (The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he justifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).       Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the "new labels" of "natural" and "unnatural" for sexual behavior.  These did not begin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even non-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu, Plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]  Linguistic Grounds';3

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you dont mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesnt support JPEG directly, youll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  Its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  Ill let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you dont have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG cant squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, dont JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision youll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesnt accomplish a lot, youll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell its been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEGs characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, Ive seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; its not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs dont even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you dont know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you dont have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- its usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you dont see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  Its available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (youll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristys free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzels free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but its functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaeis Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you dont have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so dont try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I dont know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOWs JPEG implementation isnt very good: its slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... itd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you cant get *any* of them to work, youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, dont use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Groups free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you cant get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSIs proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internets key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But its so fast youll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it cant create new JPEG files, and it doesnt view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but its an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, youll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apples JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If youre running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTimes JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, its the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some dont.  Overall, JPEGViews user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But its faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apples free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developers tool, and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as its even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technologys Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines cant use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to JPEG to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you dont want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to JPEG to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  Its cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If youre willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space its stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  Theres also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so its hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  Youll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone elses files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; dont forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and dont know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you dont know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything thats free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if youd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  Whats all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people dont have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  Were stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEGs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasnt read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients dont have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: youre stuck with the senders quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didnt use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, youre out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware. JPEGs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, youre stuck forevermore with what was sent.  Its also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often its also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This articles long enough already, so Im not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  Theres a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work thats been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  Its not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apples QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Softwares programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wont read, its likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by JFIF.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     its worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with hsi1.  Youre out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     wont decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for JFIF).  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: its a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	"begin" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	"begin" line 	M:-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  Its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If youre wondering why, its because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but thats a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, its far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Dont waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, dont expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XVs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpegs default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG cant compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than youd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you dont want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpegs built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.';1

'I replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some issues that are worth discussing in public.   I would recommend you to take a look at  1) your dictionary 2) alt.atheism FAQ files  to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_. I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without paying careful attention to this issue.    IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although Im sure the replies might keep you amused for hours.   No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual philosophies, fine, but thats not strictly atheism. Atheism is not just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life, the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could hardly be called a philosophical system.  Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities.  Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on.  Some comments on your questions:   I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to convert anyone?   This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_  cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be  beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.  Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))   This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.  Sigh, why havent I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net, anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?  Petri';0
'Alan> 2.  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing: "Marvel Alan> not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:7). Alan> Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus -- a Alan> ruler of the Jews (not a child).  Yes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement in the same conversation:  "Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit." (John 3:6)  Clearly infants are not born of the spirit.  Thus, without baptism they are unspiritual.  They are not born with the image of God, but in Adams fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3).  They have no righteousness of their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own.  There is only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive through faith.  Alan> 3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the Alan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies Alan> werent free from sin?  Your point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying that Christ used the "innocence" of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re-birth.  But this is not what he did. If you look at the text, he did not speak of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We are born of the Spirit once, not twice or several times. We are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events. It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re-birth because it is a second birth (for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second *spiritual* birth.  The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth, which is used as a symbol of `new life -- not of innocence.  When an infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither innocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual is baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a new life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians 2:5).  Then the believer has Gods assurance of the forgiveness of their sins, and of Christs imputed righteousness.

'All children are born pure, i.e., without sin. However, most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning. (Some church members would be much more judgmental, but that is *their* problem.)  In situations where welfare assistance is  provided through our Church, bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the Gospel standards and provide for  themselves.  However, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. As a former bishop of mine said, "Children are  always worthy before God."   I am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards" in this context.  Latter-Day Saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity.  If you use genealogical material or software produced by the Church, you may notice a section for "temple ordinances."  Within that section there should be a spot for signifying "BIC" which stands for "born in the covenant."  The children born to couple sealed (married) within the temple are "born in the covenant" and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit. Children born to other couples (whether in a civil marriage or not) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity.  Supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into  any eternal family unit (which may include one of the birth parents).   I cant say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing  ordinances, but it has been accepted for the  ~15 years I have been in the Church.  I would tend to discount any admonitions from the Church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the Lords plan to recover what we have done wrong the Church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure.';3

It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were inserted (badly) by later editors.  As for the four gospels being in harmony on the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.   Acts 1:18: "Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of  iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his  bowels gushed out."  Matt. 27:5-7: "And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple,  and departed, and went and hanged himself.  And the chief priests...bought  with them the potters field."   Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34  Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30   MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the  word  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.  MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.  LUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?  Verily,  verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me thrice.  JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.   (This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made!  Not the only time he does this either...)  MAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet,  saying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  zechariah 11:11-13 (nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)  What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?  scarlet - Matthew 27:28  purple John 19:2   Mark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was when the sentence was passed.   Matthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews Mark	 --  The King of the Jews Luke	 --  This is the king of the Jews John	 --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews   vinegar - Matthew 27:34  wine with myrrh - Mark 15:23   Matthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of James, and the mother of Zebedees children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far off, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less. John says that Jesuss mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and Mary Magdalene.   Matt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,  saying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice, yielded u the ghost."  Luke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto  thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."  John19:30: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is  finished:" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."   Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an earthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints.  John is the only one who mentions Jesuss side being peirced.   Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was supposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.  Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will spend "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth", and Mark 10:34 has "after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again". As far as I can see from a quick look, the prophecies have "after three days", but the post-resurrection narratives have "on the third day".   Matthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it was dark.   MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother  of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.  JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it  was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.   MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on  the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.  LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and  the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.   Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes this claim.   Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told them, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only appearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples.  Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that they told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.  Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to Emmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally recognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem, they told the disciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them, frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them.  John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in Jeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Once more Jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not recognised.  After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat together and converse.  The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of God: "And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight.  And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood by them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven, shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven" Acts 1:3-11  Paul outdoes every other "authority" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself "as one born out of due time" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.   Matthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.  John says nothing about it.  Acts contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)   MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till all these things be done.  LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till all be fulfilled.  1 thessalonians 4:15-18  1 Corinthians 15:5 (12) Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12) Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection) MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  	"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (2 Kings 2:11)  	"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	... the Son of Man." (John 3:13)  As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses, you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right!  (In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error, the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth. (Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of truth.)';0
'Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Quran. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God and His Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdies case.  There is a distinction in the Quran between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation,  the unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many Muslims, and Rushdies (and his publishers) Media games.     I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Quranic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Quran has a corresponding "circumstance of revelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Quran. The Quran asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:  "...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances  of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the Quran (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the Quran; nor is he among the people of the Quran....".  Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Quranic verses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. Ive listed a few major  divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Quran, Sunnah, Consensus, Reasoning)  The study of Quran and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the "The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied: "By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for your religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Quran and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Quran and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him.   I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup. Unfortunately, I do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like soc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?';0

'[...deletions...]   An "Islamic Bank" is something which operates in a different fashion to your modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before. For example, Islamic banks dont pay fixed interests on deposits, but a return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not fixed like interest is).  Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world. There are no Islamic banks in "the West", including the USA, to my knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not while "Islamic banks" are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an "Islamic bank" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the answer to this question is "yes", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.  Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely irrelevant.';0

'I define faith as "belief, in the abscense(sp?) of evidence". I also include in "evidence" past experiences. Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s). From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith. It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word "faith") that I find intellectually dishonest.   Pascals wager goes something like this: Premise #1: Either there is or there isnt a God. Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing. Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesnt matter because death is death, anyway. Conclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.  Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is, Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have heard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in their god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of this is "what if I pick the wrong god?" Suddenly, the odds dont look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another gods version of hell.   I dont see how "disillusionment" enters into it. You see, I presented my mothers treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mothers version of Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the right one. Im still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though, its based on the evidence of past experience) that Ill never find a religion which has all the answers. Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs youre going to find. Someone else mentioned that critisism isnt going to make me think any more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive critisism will turn me off. No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza. I merely slipped that into this post because I forgot to reply to that one.   Muppets and Garlic Toast forever.

'Conviction of Sin  		A meta-exegetical or methodological essay     I look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared over the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un- fortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didnt get a look at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly work, and I can hope that REXLEXs posting may give some meat to chew on.  However, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues -- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter. If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better; if not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.   writes, _in abstractu_:   	[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has 	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that 	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and 	NOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the 	article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]  The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and b) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The questions I wish to raise are  	1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis? and	2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the 	     discussion) that it is correct?  Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a), which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know, Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound methodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi- ate text to "fix" the coinages meaning for his audience.  As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat plausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way of construing this problem passage.)  Im going to set aside for the moment the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the more tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle, two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is, we can look at the text of Pauls letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to Pauls meaning.  The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no internal evidence for Pauls meaning.  He uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.  We are left, as the only "internal" clue, with the etymology or formation of the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before him) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with other men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex ("lie" in Leviticus, "bed" in Greek).  One problem is that "bedders" (_-koitai_) is not, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one serious test which de Youngs hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:  	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much 	   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies 	   "men who have sex with X"  [obviously, the "best case" is to 	   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]  such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way. It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under- standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesnt *prove* the hypothesis correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or not original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible of comprehension by his readers.  My "test" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT in his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage) or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering.  External evidence, that is, texts other than Pauls own and lexicographic or social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into the picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul, which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu- ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one has grounds for  	o  denying that Paul coined the word and	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning  Do you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and its intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Youngs guess) understand him to be referring to the Levitical "universal" prohibition of male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized at least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians -- how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah law to his gentile converts!)  Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined the word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or Ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be assimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?  And if he *didnt* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for his readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no other.)  I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by this word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least, had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of evidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.  So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word. And it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem. I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word:  	a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe 	    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities  	b)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual 	    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their 	    part with the Leviticus passage)  	c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an 	    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not 	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application 	    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER 	    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me 	    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses Im advancing.]  Of these, Id say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but I still have reservations about that, too.  If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence of depending on Paul, then one can opt for Pauls coining it.  If it does appear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior use (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In either of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Pauls relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be from the Greek or Jewish communities, Pauls relations are hardly straight- forward!  There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things). But it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I dont know about you, but I for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this same character (Romans 14:22-23)  	"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and 	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going 	against his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt 	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done 	in bad faith is a sin."  For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Pauls meaning in the use of _arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by the nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty of constraining Pauls own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and all the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices -- and sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you to God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Pauls words HAVE led some people), then Pauls intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences. I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I read him "in the large", if I can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)  In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm that Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as the Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo- thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and for later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow nights meditation :-)';3

'hey folks,  Im fairly new to these groups, tho some have heard from me before.  Id like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? In normal dreams, you cant control anything, so obviously you arent morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.  Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:  1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called mental hygiene, that is, not trying to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts.  2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are another plane) Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person.  A mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience. In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking life.  3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe  different) moral laws apply there.  So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know of another alternative?  respond by post or email.  thanks very much  *dt*  ========================================================';3
'More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the E&S Freedom.   Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.  ------  Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market penetration.  There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developers dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features, however, will remain much more flexible.  The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-users system. Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denalis configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade them separately as needed.  Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGIs more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications. Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable solution.  Hope this helps,  Brian';1
'Aside to the moderator:    I wont quote any of it, but there are several errors in the article. Not things that are just differences of opinion, but the writer just plain has his facts confused.

He had many friends, even leaders in Gainesville, telling him not to go, because people in the Northeast werent "open" and hed be wasting his time and talents. Really!!

'whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) sent in a list of verses  which he felt condemn homosexuality.  mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) wrote in  response that some of these verses "are used against us only through incredibly  perverse interpretations" and that others "simply do not address the issues."  [remainder of my post deleted]  The moderator then made some comments I would  like to address:   If you are referring to the terms "effeminate" and "homosexuals" in the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged.  However, I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an "incredibly perverse" interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality.  Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse. Therefore I do not believe it is "incredibly perverse" to read it in this way.   Actually, I wasnt thinking of the church at all.  After all, a couple doesnt have to be married by a minister.  A secular justice of the peace could do the job, and the two people would be married.  My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex?  And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to "save themselves" for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject.  I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position.  So what is the gay view?  - Mark';3

'If you dont agree with Josephs accurate statement of the Catholic dogma of Marys perpetual sinlessness, then how do you interpret Luke 1:28,  	And when the angel had come to her, he said, "Hail, full of  	grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women."  and Luke 1:48?   	...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.  I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of  filled to the brim, incapable of containing more.  The only other people we  know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now  (another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in  an earlier post).  Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has  ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary   was sinless.    As a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace.  But thats where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play.  I pray God to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ, which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church.  And, as you probably know, faith in Christs Church is tantamount to faith in Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christs Mystical Body.  A Catholic by nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in  Christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church  as the body of Christ.    --  Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock  Catechist gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu';3
'Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican variant you bring up.

It is indeed this judgemental, controlling legalism of many fundamentalist Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true to the Gospel of Christ, the gospel of love.  I have seen this sort of thing too often, even amoung my own relatives, to believe there is no relationship.  Judgementalism often leads to overly strict, and thus abusive, discipline of children. [This is not restricted to just Christian fundamentalism, it is found in many extreme sects of other legalistic religions].  I, too, am a Christian.  But I do not condone the use of the Bible to justify this sort of abuse.  I believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of the misapplication of the Biblical concept of discipline that such abuses can be stopped.  Just because someone is also a Christian does not mean we must identify eith them. This sort of sin needs to be made public.';3

Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying "I cant FTP, could someone mail this to me?"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

PoV - son and successor to DKB trace, written by Compuservers. 	(For more questions call Drew Wells -- 	73767.1244@compuserve.com or Dave Buck -- david_buck@carleton.ca) ART - ray tracer with a good range of surface types, part of VORT package. DKBtrace - another good ray tracer, from all reports; PCs, Mac II, 	Amiga, UNIX, VMS (last two with X11 previewer), etc. RTrace - Portugese ray tracer, does bicubic patches, CSG, 3D text, etc. etc. 	An MS-DOS version for use with DJGPP DOS extender (GO32) exists also, 	as a Mac port. VIVID2 - A shareware raytracer for PCs - binary only (286/287).  Author: 	Stephen Coy (coy@ssc-vax.boeing.com).  The 386/387 (no source) version 	is available to registered users (US$50) direct from the author. RAY4 - Steve Hollaschs 4-dimensional ray tracer - renders hyperspheres, 	hypertetrahedra, hyperplanes, and hyperparallelepipeds (theres 	a separate real-time wireframe viewer written in GL called WIRE4 ) . MTV,QRT,DBW - yet more ray tracers, some with interesting features.  Distributed/Parallel Raytracers: --------------------------------  XDART - A distributed ray-tracer that runs under X11.

Modellers, wireframe viewers: -----------------------------  VISION-3D - Mac modeler, can output Radiance & Rayshade files. IRIT - A CSG solid modeler, with support for freeform surfaces. X3D - A wireframe viewer for X11. 3DV - 3-D wireframe graphics toolkit, with C source, 3dv objects, other stuff 	Look at major PC archives like wuarchive. One such file is 3DKIT1.ZIP PV3D - a shareware front end modeler for POVRAY, still in beta test.   French docs for now, price for registering 250 French Francs. Save disabled.   Some extra utilities, DXF files for the registered version.  Geometric viewers: ------------------  SALEM - A GL-based package from Dobkin et al. for exploring mathematical 	structures. GEOMVIEW - A GL-based package for looking and interactively manipulating 3D objects, from Geometry Center at Minnesota. XYZ GeoBench -(eXperimental geometrY Zurich) is a workbench for geometric 	computation for Macintosh computers. WIRE4 - GL wireframe previewer for Steve Hollaschs RAY4 (see above)  Data Formats and Data Sets for Ray Tracing: -------------------------------------------  SPD - a set of procedural databases for testing ray tracers. NFF - simplistic file format used by SPD. OFF - another file format. P3D - a lispy file format. TDDD - Imagine (3D modeler) format, has converters for RayShade, NFF, OFF, etc. 	Also includes a nice postscript object displayer.  Some GREAT models. TTDDDLIB - converts to/from TDDD/TTDDD, OFF, NFF, Rayshade 4.0, Imagine, 	and vort 3d objects. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric 	views in Postscript. Registered users get a TeX PK font converter and 	a superquadric surfaces generator.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archies help. Dont overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DECs FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word help.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRLs postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

'genealogical  old   Well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a "bastard", I can probably speak with a bit of authority on this. Any "stigma" associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests solely upon the parents--theyve committed a sexual transgression for which they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the parents sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of Mormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases holds parents responsible for their childrens sins if they have failed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).  Also note that there is no "big genealogical book in Salt Lake City". The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening, baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I may be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2 billion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is building up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there some kind of "worthiness screening" as to whether someone can be entered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the parents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database. ..bruce..  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bruce F.

'Here is a press release from the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees.   Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions Commemorate Workers Memorial Day  To: National Desk, Labor Writer  Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130     WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.    This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work. Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert Vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in Lucasville, Ohio.    The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years.  On Jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.    The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain high.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff, compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.    The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis B, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.    AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nations federal, state and local correctional facilities.    Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nations most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:     -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and       frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are       not barricaded or dont have proper lighting.    -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of       job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector       employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more       than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private       sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the       previous year.  It is generally believed that health care       workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes       have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses       than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety       issues facing health care workers include exposure to       tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high       levels of stress.    -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health       institutions are often the victims of assaults and,       sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man       carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler       County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.       and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the       gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a       growing lack of support services for people who dont have       the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some       clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.       Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.       The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent,       as more are moved out of the institutions.     Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees.    "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees," said McEntee.  "This, despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers, corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful."    Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe.    Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed in 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states have no OSHA coverage.  -30-';2

'I dont see how this logically follows.  True enough, Mary received a blessing beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be  the mother of the Savior.  It says nothing about Mary needing to be a "blessed  person" _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of  God.  Again, I think the problem is that as humans we cant comprehend how the  sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and Gods Spirit. Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God, we must needs try to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be.  Marys own words,   "...my spirit rejoices in God _my Savior_, for he has regarded the low  estate of his handmaiden,..."  sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity, in need of a  Savior, similar to what David proclaimed in his psalms...not the words of a holy being with no further need for Gods grace.  I really apologize for harping on this, I dont suppose its important. Its just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid, serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose to come down to you and I, to be born of people like you and I, to share our existence and redeem us from its fallenness by his holy Incarnation.';3

'----- Begin Included Message -----  The following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm Smith Ministries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of God.  If you would like more info on the ministry, and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial, e-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.   LOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)  by Malcolm Smith  Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation before the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh, gateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than Gods way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would have given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their decision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision- makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a sigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they were going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence. Whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation at Kadesh and had God s promise of one day entering the land. The forty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those who were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over. All these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden. His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. "Who is your God?" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When Aaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young bull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypts gods as He led Israel to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow thin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the God of Almightiness becomes "ho-hum --What s next on the miracle menu?" And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might be all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right to do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and mens lives had hung on the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed God could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM and, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His acts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the day of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God. At Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He had seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This request was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of Gods glorious Person. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and lovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word "lovingkindness" is not to be understood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the love that says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Lovingkindness is as tenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on feelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and, therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. Gods love is not an emotion that wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our highest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings of love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with us! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him to reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not because of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed to us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will not let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us-- but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is saying to the recipient, "For as long as we shall live, I am for you."  The God who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in His coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is lovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never leave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as love; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing miracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the heart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power. Moses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for these people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out of knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who gives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to miss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If man is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from love demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mothers love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for, protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were to ask, "What has the baby done to deserve this?" or, "Have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?" Our questions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was conceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with loves excitement, a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents love is unconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally, spontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after His image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the Lord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents love. It is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if it survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in the love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and gladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His love. "Satisfied." in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our deepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems disappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the emotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in religious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living God. Only in knowing Gods love will the rest of life make sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it fascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His love. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by the knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew better. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We wont find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes and satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God to make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the love of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church, we read of the Holy Spirit "falling upon" the believers. This is an ancient expression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in Luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and "falling on his neck and kissing him." The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes. Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught us to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance and love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy Spirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to think on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded with the doctrine of "perform to be accepted." We begin to realize that He loves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge everyone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your eyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not feel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the other day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to Moses, "joy and gladness all our days." Joy is the result of a life that is functioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man s highest performance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and, in joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.';3
'I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed. The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about), doesnt include any US equipment.  Their missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about 100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it.   Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly conclusive evidence that the US didnt sell arms to Iraq.  Information is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that fact is classified, and you cant prove it.  If you can provide some useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq, I am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what "everyone knows".';0

'MC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of MC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis MC> 1.  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  And which order of Creation do you accept?	The story of creation is one of the many places in the Bible where the Story contradicts itself.  The following is an example...  GEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle  after  their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. GEN 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image,  after  our likeness:  and  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and  over  all the  earth,  and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  GEN 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is  not  good  that  the  man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. GEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the  field,  and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature, that was the name thereof.

'Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?  Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd.  So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:    In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.  As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV.

'Organization: Temple University X-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.2  Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown. They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? I dont have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but on the couple of occasions when Ive gone to a new doctor, I met him with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there for and took a history, all before I undressed.   Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time? Personally, Id prefer to meet the doctor on something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.

'Sadly understandable...   Yes.  To be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.   Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didnt say all that many things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of "personal interpretation".   This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to the point of "testing hypotheses" against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.   Interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant, unfortunately.   Granted   In which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun, merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if I may be so bold as to extend your similie?

'-*----  I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections.

'Ive seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays. In the examples Ive seen, drugs were definitely involved.   My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug. Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there arent many medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.  I dont mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe that, because they have close control of you, its quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those circumstances.   I grant you that sometimes theres no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss it with an independent doc.

'Luke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about  the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations 20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are thrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where a fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the Matthew 25 passage it doesnt seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual.    From Dales question, I come away with the suggestion that hell, if it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living forever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the  unbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on continually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it. It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid regardless of its exact nature.   There seem to be two main questions in Dales thought: What is Gods main plan on earth? Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed to simply destroying completely those who refuse God?  I believe that Gods main plan is to have a genuine relationship with people.  The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something to avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has nothing to do with God.  In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance, it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is burned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a physical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive, at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is no longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement, the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they cant feel physical pain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are to be forever without God.    The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people wont listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ. It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is not even remotely pleasant.';3

'Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.  Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.  Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.   Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24 bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

'Diplomatic :-)  I realize Im fighting Occams razor in this argument, so Ill try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, Im not impressed with the ability of algorithms. Theyre great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, obfuscate the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isnt used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but (again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of if you see object X, then perform action Y, and we dont seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what conclusions to draw from its experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also, neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of its code?  The next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace colour with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the materialist viewpoint is that its the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a computer wont see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesnt? It shouldnt, because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?    A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called Unitary Evolution (or U), is governed by Schroedingers equation and is well known. The second process, called various things such as collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction (or R), and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a measurement takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and something else, which I shall imaginitively call part X. It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the wavefunction. Note, though, that wed need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway, Im speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear superpositions of anything, although there are alternative explainations for this. Ive no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X, but since this is only speculation, that wont matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.  Ill go back to my nice padded cell now, if thats OK with you :-)   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Kevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk             Dont believe anything you read in .sig files.';0
'My brothers affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweets syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweets syndrome.  	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. Shed been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it.   	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but shes isnt being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the hospital because of the Sweets syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).  Ive looked through the last two years of Medline and didnt find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. .

'[Im going to cut "Rex"s ramblings down a bit.]  [...]     Rex, there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree Masons in this country, and thousands of 33rds. If nasty stuff was really going on, dont you think youd have more than a couple of disgruntled members "exposing" it? Heck, if what you say is true, then Rev. Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper.   [... Long quote from someone named Hislop (source not given) deleted. Im attempting to extract from it the relevent points:     * Osiris is actually Nimrod, a Babylonian Deity.     * "It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally     founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or     wife of Osiris."    * The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building     trade, ie, with Masonry.    * Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro. [isnt this refering to a      Biblical Nimrod, rather than the Babylonian god?]    *  ...there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that Osiris      was black. ...]       There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. This dates right back to the Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. Ive seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians, and Atlanteans. I even have a book which claims to prove that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple.       Claims prove nothing. Wheres the beef, Rex?  [...Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge]     Id have to check this. The tomb paintings I remember dont show this.      Can you give ancient citations for this?

'My last response in this thread fell into a bit-bucket and vanished (though appearing locally).  Ill repost it, since I always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread, I dont want Rob to think Im doing so.  Since this is now dated, however, dont feel compelled to respond...   I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a "face value" interpretation...   While the context of the time is important, value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people, for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the Bibles own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.   Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see no support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesnt mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.   Note that Im speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance claiming that Hammurabis "an eye for an eye" was primitive brutal retribution, while Moses version was an enlightened benign fine (because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As of 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.   I dont belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual ones, of the Jewish people.  I have given up on trying to think by analogy, since I dont know of any other tribe that is at all similar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I dont know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison).  I think a tradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation, is a good thing.  I think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a 1943 Captain America comic (or whatever the Babylonian equivalent would have been). --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

'[...stuff deleted...]  As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the  _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render  that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say that you dont believe something than it is to say that you dont have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  think about.  Its not either or.  Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind.    I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put  his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.';0
'Hypostasis  [Ive explained it here before.  If you want the full document, ask me by mail --Rex]       "Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner consciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ briefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the attributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would mean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death, free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm of the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which was not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the divine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die, not in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human nature.      This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the human nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the person. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited power, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There is, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential perfection of the Godhead.      We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the possession of the double natures.  Christs human nature is impersonal, in that it attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the God-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the Man. Nature is defined:  "the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental character, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and unchangeable."       Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such the Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind.  Personality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the power of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature of Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.  LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally important to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as such, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say that Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is theanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the human and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will are simply human or simply divine."   [The quotation given above is not identified, and its not entirely clear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity, let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic Christological heresies -- monothelitism.  Thats the position that Christs two natures were not complete, in that there was only one will.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the human will that was regarded as missing.  Normally people who talk about Christs human nature as being "impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they are using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of personality.  In this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia". Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of denying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never been formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the quotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went, into the realm of the overtly heretical.';3

'As I understand, that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but is still surviving.

A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions.    2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  That figure came not from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such stuff in another part of DoD.  3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.

Such methods are used all the time to lie with statistics.   I have _never_ seen any source that was claiming such a figure.  Please post the source so its reliability can be judged.';0
'Mark, this is the most reasonable post that Ive seen in Sci. Med. on the  topic of Colonic Flushing.

He decided that there had to be a  better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being  worse than the disease.

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you dont mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesnt support JPEG directly, youll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  Its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  Ill let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you dont have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG cant squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, dont JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision youll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesnt accomplish a lot, youll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell its been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEGs characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, Ive seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; its not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs dont even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you dont know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you dont have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- its usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you dont see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  Its available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (youll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristys free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzels free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but its functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaeis Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you dont have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so dont try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I dont know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOWs JPEG implementation isnt very good: its slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... itd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you cant get *any* of them to work, youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, dont use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Groups free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you cant get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSIs proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internets key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But its so fast youll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it cant create new JPEG files, and it doesnt view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but its an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, youll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apples JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If youre running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTimes JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, its the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some dont.  Overall, JPEGViews user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But its faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apples free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developers tool, and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as its even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technologys Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines cant use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to JPEG to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you dont want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to JPEG to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  Its cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If youre willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space its stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  Theres also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  Youll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone elses files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; dont forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and dont know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you dont know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything thats free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if youd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  Whats all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people dont have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  Were stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEGs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasnt read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients dont have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: youre stuck with the senders quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didnt use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, youre out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware. JPEGs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, youre stuck forevermore with what was sent.  Its also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often its also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This articles long enough already, so Im not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  Theres a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work thats been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  Its not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apples QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Softwares programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wont read, its likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by JFIF.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     its worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with hsi1.  Youre out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     wont decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for JFIF).  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: its a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	"begin" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	"begin" line 	M:-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  Its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If youre wondering why, its because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but thats a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, its far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Dont waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, dont expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XVs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpegs default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG cant compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than youd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you dont want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpegs built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.';1

'Yup.  Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right).  I cant remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEGs to GIFs before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards. You dont need any special hardware to view JPEGs except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a 8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIFs and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way gives a brighter more detailed image.  Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as far as I know, you dont need extra hardware to view JPEGs other than the VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)  Have a day!';1

'ites: I realized that my generalizations would probably have problems under scrutiny from various  Asian points of view.  They need to be  discussed in detail, indeed. But for the purposes of this newsgroup  and thread  thus far and in this newsgroup, I risked oversimpli- fication.  My main purpose was to emphasize that I was not coming from a Buddhist or Hindu point of view.  As you observed, the main context is that of Christianity.  But by all means, add comments and corrections as you find them.  I wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points, but decided to not post it. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc.religion. eastern. Instead I just add the following couple of items about karma  and reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and  a Christian point of view.  1. Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a "judging    deity".  2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again.  3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body.  4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings    of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death,    and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness,     salvation, and the last judgement.   Origens work was mostly lost. He was not anathematized, to my knowledge,  but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies. Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen.  I dont know if there is a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I do know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another.  I dont know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in the Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II from an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes to go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he can relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance, an anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and Anthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an actor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner and based his acting and directing methods on Steiners indications.  Part of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well, going to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another Polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about Anthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask him what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said,  "Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in  reincarnation," and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times to modern times.  Then he changed the subject. My Polish friend did not say whether Origen was among those he mentioned.  Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)';3

'...  If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from speaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could err. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious transgression CHRIST would have condemned it.  I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying to stamp out something that CHRIST didnt consider worth a single word of condemnation.

'The Vatican library recently made a tour of the US.  Can anyone help me in finding a FTP site where this collection is   available.';1
'I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher), and read it, "cover to cover" (to use a phrase that seems popular here right now).  And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the "yaar" at the end of a sentence, "Butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)  At the time I still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and I couldnt see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammeds wives, and had not (as my grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammeds wives were prostitutes; in short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely.  (And I wont mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)  Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent? She can come directly to me, cant she? How do we know that Muhammed didnt just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didnt screw up, or put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some "holy" guy. Not to mention murder the author.)   I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read "Mein Kampf?" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why dont they just read the book and decide for themselves?  Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of protest from the "liberal" muslims to Khomeinis fatwa outrage, was the final push I needed into atheism!  -s';0

'Yes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly our decision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own private opinion.  However, when reading Scripture, we have to remember that the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and that the interpretation that matters is the one God intended.  For example, if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the doctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended interpretation.  The prophets didnt make up this teaching; it came from God, and we must accept it as such.  This necessarily means that our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God intended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to determine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically accepted as the infallible interpretation of God.  We need to test the spirits to see if they are from God.  When the Holy Spirit speaks, he says the same thing to all; he wont tell me that a passage means one thing and tell you it means another.  If the two of us come to conflicting conclusions, we cant both be completely right.  We know our interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole agrees on what Scripture means.  This is how we know the doctrines of the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly.  These matters are not up for private interpretation.  This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of the false teachers.  They preferred their own private interpretation to the God-given teaching of the apostles.  It is through such private interpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced in Scripture, are started.';3

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among  21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This  report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDCs National Hospital  Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.       Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been  collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDCs National Center  for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were  abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484  participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior  cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national  estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged  after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were  calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from  national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of  cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based  solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at  the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value  of 1.96.       In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as  in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean  rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no  previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5.  In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05)  higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast  (22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years  than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or  government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger  hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other  private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of  payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries.       Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women  increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained  the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3,  essentially the same as the 23.5 observed.       Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated  338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary  cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been  performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean  delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991,  35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e.,  failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal  distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications.       The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In  comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days,  and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC  deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3  days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for  primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and  non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively.   Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center  for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from  1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates  have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that  maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because  cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of  childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the  overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary  cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).       Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections  -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries  than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for  cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in  1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and  $4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes  $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean  rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number  of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000),  resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital  charges.       Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may  impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean  delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women  offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7).  Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7)  --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely  offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data)  was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all  women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was  attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the  VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary  rate.       One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by  applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean  delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review  process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates  include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing  reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of  physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public  awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns,  which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean  delivery (4).

Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents  stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and  unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of  State (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases  among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the  health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27  cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June  1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and  CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and  identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This  report summarizes the results of the investigation.       Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were  available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if  the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide- confirmed as having malaria.       A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to  obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria  chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets  and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long  sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey,  128 (82%) responded.       Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in  Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less  than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15  years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk  RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the  cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years,  compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the  Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for  malaria.       Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who  participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine  alone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were  not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly  lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88  9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37  24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported  side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason.       The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely  used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was  also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening  (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0;  upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with  failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the  evening.       As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel  the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis  regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection  measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to  provide window and door screens for all personnel.

Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases,  National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.   Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was  attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis  regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased  malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan  Africa. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and  continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in  malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for  short-term travelers to such areas.       Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most  other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas  (e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In  Africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in  preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and  well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk  for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis  (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000  users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness,  gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for  other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1).       Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need  for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen  (3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense  chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for  persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil  is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be  used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P.  falciparum has not been reported.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and  pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the  United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than  90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these  organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely  recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined  vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate  injections.       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products  for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b  conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for  vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus  toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine  (TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in  vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease.                                  ActHIB Trademark        On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T),  manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB  Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This  vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary  vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously  unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months  apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one  dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all  children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive  a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving  a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4,  and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b  polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to  that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed  Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in  prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early  because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease  were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and  other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to  that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark       On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus  toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl  River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL  Registered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and  Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis  Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York).       This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years  for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when  indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody  responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark  is expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus,  and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other  DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines.       The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that  all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b  conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose  primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2,  4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A  complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and  TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah  Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of  California, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific  program committee provided guidance.       The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including  Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United  States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National  Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research,  and the Procter and Gamble Company.       Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics,  professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision  of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and  mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and  womens issues.                                   Recommendations       Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association  between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to  establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for  more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology  studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral  lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions.                                    Epidemiology       Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV  Infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely  in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.   Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in  children and adolescents.       While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a  major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.   Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more  are appearing all the time.       Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions  such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore  the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression  and prognosis.                               Social/political Issues       Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection  focused on changing the publics attitude that AIDS is retribution for  indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health  care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public  about what AIDS is, and how it is acquired.                             Saliva and Salivary Glands       Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory  activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary  secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular  secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid  secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible  for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect  of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both  promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2)  direct effects on the virus or target cells.       Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease  in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity.                                  Pediatric Issues       Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With  early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from  mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mothers  sero-status is known prior to giving birth.

Recommendations made at  the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of  diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration  of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy.                          Occupational and Treatment Issues       Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals  and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command  considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit  of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection  and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the  treatment of HIV-infected patients.       Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on  the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.   Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence  Company in late 1993.                       --------- end of part 1 ------------';2

'[bible verses ag./ used ag. homosexuality deleted]   also check out the episcopal church -- although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women, there certainly is a fairly large percentage (in my experience) who are.  i am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous homosexual relationship.  this in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his community, as well as a very significant aids ministry.  my uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think about what the bible has to say about this and what i feel God thinks about this.  obviously my conclusions may be wrong; nonetheless they are my own and they feel right to me.  i believe that the one important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly _inherent_ rather than completely learned.  this means that to a certain extent -- or to a great extent -- homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about other people -- which is why reports of "curing" homosexuals always chill me and make me feel ill.  please not that, although i cant cite sources where you can find this information, there is homosexual behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals, which is in itself suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned, or at least that the word "unnatural" shouldnt really apply....  please remember that whatever you believe, gays and lesbians shoul not be excluded from your love and acceptance.  christ loved us all, and we ALL sin.  and he himself never said anything against homosexuals -- rather it is paul (who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as "women shouldnt speak in church" and "women should keep their heads covered in church" -- not exact quotations as i dont have my bible handy) who says these things.  i have a tendency to take some of the things paul says with a grain of salt....  well, thats all ill say for now.   vera noyes';3

'This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which I have begun reading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, I will conclude here as well.  A week ago, I managed to find time to consult a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library, and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the Jewish scriptures.  The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover."  This cluster occurs just where one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation) of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea 2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel 16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.  	[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and 	  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not 	  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]  The "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is evident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like "of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see that standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the Hebrew! :-)  More interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine usage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say), _eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very valuable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd context -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be "say."  In addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs), Esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application,   	kai e:rasthe" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther  and, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:  	kai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra 	-- and Jonathan, Sauls son, loved David intensely  	[ Im using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I 	  dont yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]  (The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the "erotic" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_ for erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alone would mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this translator goes!)';3

'marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Kevin Marshall) <1r2eba$hsq@csugrad.cs.vt.edu>  Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That is what I mean by the word ``faith: belief without justification, or belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational) justification.  For example, when someone says that God exists, that they dont know why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, thats faith.  Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information, or increased mental faculty.  Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion, because there is no faith nor dogma.  Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.  A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore, to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed. Sure, interpretations of what ``God said are changed to satisfy the needs of society, but when God says something, thats it.  It was said, and thats that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the interpretations are flawed.  Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma. A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND, *AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available.  Thats the only rational thing to do.  Thats good philosophy.  Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed, and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion views its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them.  Its easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesnt require a good rational justification of the killing.  I dont consider ``hes Jewish, or ``he was born of Jewish parents, or ``this document says hes Jewish to be good rational justification.

'Michael> The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is Michael> that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket Michael> equation of homosexual behavior and rape.  Since Christians Michael> citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have Michael> at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge Michael> that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.  and  Michael>  It is just Michael> as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so its a Michael> secondary argument from the phobic contingent) to equate Michael> homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the Michael> rape of Gods messengers.  Lets review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly.  It states clearly that the visitors were angels.  But "all the men from every part of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to  you tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex  with them. "   For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21 that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before the angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square--which simply indicates  the extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser  degrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us believe.  Ultimately our understanding of Gods will for sexuality comes from the creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He created us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female, "Therefore a man will leave his father and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh."  This marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between  two men, or between two women.  Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from or expresses Gods will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus the Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest, homosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbors wife; other commandments forbade rape. The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage relationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural, Romans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Pauls opinion, but because it was contrary to Gods purpose in creating us male and female.    Michael> Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here Michael> and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they Michael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously Michael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL Michael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest Michael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can Michael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they Michael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss Michael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what Michael> it is.

'Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present.  I dont know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output, but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all.  The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 - one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the bodys cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order.  Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physicians reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-) and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local library).

'Someone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality.  Since it hasnt been posted for some time (and Ive modified it somewhat since the last time), Im taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though primarily from a conservative point of view.  ----------------------------  This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and Christians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the question each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is "how can a Christian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about it?"  First, on the definition of homosexual.  Many groups believe that there is a homosexual "orientation", i.e. a sexual attraction to members of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the term homosexual means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex. This is generally not accepted outside the most liberal groups.  In this paper Im going to use homosexual as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I havent heard of any Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate.  I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual.  This is often called a homosexual orientation.  It is not known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence suggesting each.  The best evidence Ive seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of them is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is Exodus International".  The reports Ive seen (and I havent read the detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the Presbyterian Churchs infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that these programs have very low success rates, and that there are questions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly are people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as important as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact that its hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that its hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If its wrong, its wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though. If its very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it.  One more general background issue: Its common to quote a figure that 10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where this came from.  Heres his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey, one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey Institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I cant put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online information for Kinseys own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog at Rutgers:    AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.

LC CARD    48005195 This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even been found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in the recent NEWSWEEK coverstory "Is this child gay?" (Feb. 24, 1992).  A journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes Kinseys study, but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook......  Ive seen some objections to the Kinseys study, but not in enough detail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another view, Id be willing to include it.)  Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong. Not all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows it, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal Church seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that have congregational government, youll find a few congregations that accept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably only one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches permit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is another issue.  I dont have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.  As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, heres an attempt to summarize the issues:  The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell: "Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality", U Chicago Press, 1980.  The argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws in the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g. the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults. (Theres even some question whether it was homosexual, since the entities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, youll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  Theres a Jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any rate, theres no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.  I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT justification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.  The NT references are all in Pauls letters.  A number of the references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not in the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and /arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests "wanton" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has vanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less frowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the early Latin translations, would be "active mode homosexual male prostitute", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.  For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fees commentary on I Cor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate. However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee say taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it isnt a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it is that the word is almost never used.  Pauls writing is the first occurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of "male" and "f**k" unfortunately doesnt quite tell us the meaning, since it doesnt tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given. In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  Its dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology, or youll conclude that "goodbye" is a religious expression because its based on "God by with ye".  However since Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on "homosexual male prostitute", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something which Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation).  In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans 1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what Paul meant.  However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom 1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- its homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness. Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, Im sure Paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex. Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality. But in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a specific feature of homosexuality.  My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of homosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality in passing.  The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look to Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT prohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal, it is not surprising that they regard Pauls negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described.  Theres not a lot I can do as moderator about such a situation.  A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact Im not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the question of whether Pauls judgement should apply to modern homosexuality.  One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act "straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Pauls judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions.  Another is the following: In Pauls time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It was part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  Im not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some reasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal. Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children, slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners.  (However Fees commentary on I Cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations in this paragraph shouldnt be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have been discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children.)  Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against homosexuality.  Id like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for AIDS.  Note that there is good reason from Pauls general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative, apart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what God ordained.  However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally.  I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Pauls tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication.  I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is not what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still conclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This doesnt mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that its a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness.  If youre willing to consider the latter approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it. The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.  This is going to depend upon ones assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it. Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes AIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to Christian heterosexual relationships.)  In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, weve heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in this situation.  Ive also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for "conversion".  (Aside from the Presbyterian report mentioned above, theres an FAQ that summarizes our readers reports on this question.)  The evidence is that long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to depend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesnt happen, which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe homosexuality isnt Gods original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis suggests wasnt part of Gods original ideal either -- I think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing Gods love with each other.  Theres an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this discussion.  The issue is that of "cultural relativism".  That is, when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative?  When looking at this issue, its worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians consider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:    - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in 	the OT -- its not in the NT, but I mention it here because 	until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding 	on Christians)   - prohibition against swearing oaths   - endorsement of slavery as an institution   - judgement of tax collectors as sinner  We do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:    - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific 	agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build, 	but not to our market economy.   - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the 	same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was 	concerned about   - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people 	how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as 	an institution   - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to 	Roman tax farming  The point Im trying to make is that before applying Biblical prohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed, slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants or slaves of God.)  I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally relative.  Rather, Im trying to say that *some* things are, and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the action were talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding, Im willing to listen.  Those who claim that the question doesnt need to be looked at are kidding themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above).  One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence -- some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among Christians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved. This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I cant help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a dangerous situation for Christians.  On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented. One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined.  I.e. "God made me homosexual", and I have no choice.  I think "God made me homosexual" is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I dont see it as an argument for acceptability.';3
'Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth. They should remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Jerome did not hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as Scripture in his later writings.  And as I have already pointed out, in a previous letter on this subject, the Catholic Church has accepted the deuterocanon from the beginning.  And the Protestants in the 1500s all of a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by Pope, Council, and Church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired.  Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the Christian use of the Septuagint.                 ^^^^^';3

'Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist.  A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein.   After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high  concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.  As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line.  What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system.  I hope I have answered some of your questions.

'Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some  hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your own, or at your physicians office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and   firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl  under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse it out. Good Luck -heather';2

'[continuing with Dr. DeYoungs article-]                  SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI  D.S. Bailey       D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those who engage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing of "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the terms reference in Pauls works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as "homosexuals."  Bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual *condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics in source].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatts translation "sodomites" best represents Pauls meaning in Baileys judgment (39).  Bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.  J. Boswell       The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive sense.        In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguistic evidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "male sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes."  His argument is that the arseno- part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male sexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most interpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, make their bed with, men."  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes ("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such as paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More directly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective (343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.       Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti.  These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive would be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that arsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to Paul for a male prostitute," since by Pauls time the Attic words pornos ("fornicator") and porneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the LXX, had been adopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication."*7       In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus, Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai "did not connote homosexual or even sodomite in the time of Paul" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus Empiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussions of homosexual relation" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including the Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his omission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11        Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses "circumlocutions."  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius Felix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife (353).       Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes,      There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted    homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every reason    to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of    Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).  It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not disapprove of "gay inclination,"  "gay relationships,"  "enduring love between persons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism"  (112, 166-17).   ________________________________________________________ 4.

Yet Polycarp, who was a disiple of Hohn the Apostle and died about A.D. 155, argues in the context that young men should be pure.  He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai from Pauls list.  This at least makes Boswells use of "all" subjective.

Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostoms use of arsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1, or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when Chrysostom uses it.  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our study, whether in the lists or other discussions.  Boswell later admits (351) that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on I Cor.  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that Paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.   12.  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders arsenokoitai as "masculorum concubitores," corresponding "almost exactly to the Greek" (348 n.36).  footnotes: _______________________  5.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, theres a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used    for the results Id been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     Thats right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. Id try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I dont think its    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTimes normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didnt work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I cant believe that QuickTimes synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac systems task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldnt see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, Im not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.  Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...  -Peter Lee';1

This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore: to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as the ones above and those such as, "How can u trust science, science was invented by man!", only goes to further show the weakness of their religion.  In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses. They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature of their faith. They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.

'David, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline  search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since  commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or  bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative. This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are  recommended rather than yogurt.  I guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteria  back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the  anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a  facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and  colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain  the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion  was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the  intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida  looses its major food source.  Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is  normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal  yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has  been used to get this effect but Ive not seen any such treatment reported in  the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting  their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their  patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if  ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age  emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the  medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to  help patients or does it look the other way.  This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous  therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But  there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty  hot and somebody could get burned.  Its really tough.  Do I follow only  well established protocols and then give up if they dont work that well or  do it try something that looks like it will work but hasnt been proven to  work yet?  My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they  involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into  the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other  is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a  problem with recurring yeast infections.';2
'Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections.  Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of my routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria after antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a "logical extension" from the available observations Ill leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials.    One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora.  Dont try this at home.      Except that it isnt. At least symptomatically apparent disease.     Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical trial, like:   AU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D. TI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the      candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments] SO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.      psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens      and the all-placebo regimen      significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than      0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms      significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]      CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis      hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or      psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,      the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such      women appears to be unwarranted.    Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didnt use *Sporanox* (despite Crooks recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didnt avoid those carbohydrates . . .      Marty, youve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about "real" candida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We cant seem to focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.';2

For someone to lay claim to an alternative #moral system, he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be #internally consistent.    Why?  Your last statement.  Why are these things necessary?    And believe me, a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly consistent.  #Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and #thus may be incapable of behaving morally.  While someone like Hitler #may have believed that his actions were moral, we may judge him immoral #by our standards.  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean #that we must excuse the murderer.  Trouble is, this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler, too. (I do *not* mean any comparison or offence, David.)   Try substituting  the social minority of your choice for sociopath, Hitler,  and murderer.  No logical difference.  Someone like you, vs. someone like Hitler. Zero sum.';0

'Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two, then, and have been with  continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds. Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished that I did not give her that awful Septra.)    There are the net studies -- that is, if you read this newsgroup often, there will be a round of questions like this every month.  There might be formal studies like that, but bear with my not so academic experience. Okay?  Gee, I bet 50/50 youll hear cases in all these catagories.   I am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less.  But, that child  still will face the world one day.    Thats what I believe and comfort myself with.  Caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other  kids mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily. However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold, we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp  at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net). Thats about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she fought the illness off.  I do understand that you dont have much choice if the child is in pain and/or high fever.    If the child doesnt rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime, then the child should be stronger.  Ill leave this to expert.  If your child just entered daycare, Im pretty sure the first 6 months will be the hardest.  (Then, you get more used to it.  Boy, do I hate to see me typing this sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September, I said  to myself, oh, sure.  But, I do get used to it, now.)  However, I do hear  people say that it does get better after a year or two.  I am looking forward  to a healthier next winter.  As it gets warmer, I hope you do get some break  soon.  Eat well, sleep well.  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary.  Good luck.

'Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is  relevant for med students too.  Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy,  histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass  memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most  med students are.  Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I  have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have never applied them to large amounts of "data".  Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or cheap software?     Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an older student who returned to school this year, organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.  Please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong  points.  But you cant get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization.';2
'Point 1:  Im beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole "yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon", necessary for precise communication within their field (which Im fully cognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise dont see much of in their practice except for the occasional "difficult" patient.  Point 2:  I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it follows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view.  And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where "standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment.  What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them.  This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - Im sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.  Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure "scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and by the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus statements,  "...whilst if there were any at all, that attempted to pervert  the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking  in dark retreats..."

Just in looking at two of the four  references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the  _Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for  such interpretations.

The links for Jays using _EH_ for support are: "imparting the gift  of knowledge" = "imparted secret information" = "being given secret  signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven."  But there is not enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call  this "favorable interpretation."  It appears to be closer to  "fabrication."';3
'Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we are beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are, and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day care and we think its great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny.  Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?  -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on home care vs. day care?  -- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later), does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it not have any long term effect?  -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects?  -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal, and what does one do about it?  -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

': Arrogance is arrogance.  It is not the result of religion, it is the result : of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and ones desire to show : others of ones rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our : sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the  : judge, well probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged  : ourselves.    Im not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove ones superior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another persons beliefs.  I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area I hope you will forgive me.  Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that ones God is greater than the gods of others or of believing that ones religion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied beliefs.  It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong. Were I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow what I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs correct.  Thats not arrogance.  Thats unavoidable behavior.  It is nonsense to say that I believe another persons god to be greater than my God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldnt I be obligated to change so that their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship that God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?  Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation of ones superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.  Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling Gods work of creation in our lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another, "Im not very smart.  Im poor.  Im not good looking.  Im just a worm in the ground.  Im such a weak person and although I dont want to sin, I really cannot help it."  Were this person truely humble, he would take a different approach.  "God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know that you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me, I have been so unthankful.  Youve given me power to resist the devil.  I have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so.  Lord, with all youve given me, I have been completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to save me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life Ive led.  Lord, please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring glory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord Im so sorry for my wrongs.  Please help me to change."  :  : I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because : they dont want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically : dont have anything to do with them.  For me, Ive often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company.  When Im wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly dont feel like being confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness, Id be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me. At the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about living my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me silently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private, Id feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help in changing from the error of my ways.  The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not. It isnt easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in ones ability to serve God.  Its easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering Gods creation in our lives instead.  : But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right] : and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance, : many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if : we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and : over again by the words of others, youd think wed either toughen up : or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you : can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesnt make that : reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination : that we can change our emotional reactions. :   Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devils aim is to get us into as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci- less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons.

'> Im leaning... SIRACH... is more directly referenced by JAMES  > than JOB or RUTH is... in any NT verse Ive seen.  It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and from JAMES.  Job 5:13 ("He taketh the wise in their craftiness") seems to be quoted in 1 Corinthians 3:19.  James 5:11 ("You have heard of the patience of Job"), while not a quote, implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience. It is possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew Bible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the same problem with direct quotes.)  Again, Matthew 1:5 ("Boaz begat Obed of Ruth") tells us that Matthew knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz and  became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in the OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was familiar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.  References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical. But neither do direct quotes.';3

'"We however, shall be innocent of this sin, and will pray with earnest entreaty and supplication that the Creator of all may keep unharmed the numbers of His elect."     -St. Clement, Bishop of Rome, Letter to the Corinthians, 59.2, (c. 90 AD)  "Ignatius also called Theophorus, to the Church at Ephesus in Asia, which is worthy of all felicitation, blessed as it is with greatness by the fullness of God the Father, predestined from all eternity for a glory that is lasting and unchanging, united and chosen in true suffering by the will of the Father in Jesus Christ our God..."     -St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, Letter to the Ephesians, Address, (c 110 AD)  "We say therefore, that in substance, in concept, in orgin and in eminece, the ancient and Catholic Church is alone, gathering as it does into the unity of the one faith which results from the familiar covenants .... those already chosen, those predestined by God who knew before the foundation of the world that they would be just."     -St. Clement, Patriarch and Archbishop of Alexandria, Miscellanies, 7.17.107.3, (c 205 AD)  Of course the doctrine was explained more fully later on by Sts. Augustine, Aquinas, etc., but the seeds were ther from the beginning.   I think you are reading it wrong.  I say those who are not saved are not saved on account of their own sins.  It is not because God did not give them sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men might be saved.  However, as only some are saved - and those who are saved are saved by the grace of God, "not by works, lest any man should boast" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to heed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and chosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not predestined, but reprobated instead.   Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could have their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing God to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided into those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the road to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus, no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect and predestined.  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God).   You must admit it is possible.  Anyway, why would you want something in the hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said. This is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who are rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them their blessing know, as they have chosen.  Remeber, Jesus promised tribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are Christians.  He did not promise heaven on earth.  He promised heaven.   Not really.  Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it in Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with poorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved through fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for whatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of course, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really little excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul.  And no comments were taken as flames.  You are one of the more polite people I have talked to over the net.  Andy Byler';3

'This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the "deuteroncanonicals" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the Hebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just dictating his translation to an amanuensis.  That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the first steps in "reducing" these books from the status they had (and have) among the Greeks.  Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers "threw out" these books.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these ALONE.  I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek) are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow "more inspired" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable -- than a translation, as if we could not hear Gods word to the Jews in Greek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current "inerrancy" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of course, Anglicans dont do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.  BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of translation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome, above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two of four have been published so far.';3

'(This is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med. Set the follow-up (line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or (e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.)  I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I couldnt spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps.     This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we couldnt find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else.     Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.  Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. Ive got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me, and come for me, even when Im in the middle of a crowd. So far only two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows.

'Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A persons self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mental/verbal level, and dont usually find expression in society except in an impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.   Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue...    Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous "do what you want so long as it doesnt hurt others?"  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it is not a morality in that it doesnt propound any specifically preferred behaviours.   Ill add a hearty "me two".

'way.qub.ac.uk writes (single angle brackets):  ng   There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John. The passage in Matthew is very direct.  Where Luke (1:17) reports the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ "in the  power and spirit of Elias", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,        "And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who     was to come".  It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, "If you care to accept it", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein- carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it is.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other topics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of reincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews today, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah Hurnard ("Hinds Feet on High Places") was told about it by a Rabbi she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine. Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this, whereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about  John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded but nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one way or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general of the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are  occasional indications that point to it.  As for the "popular belief" that Elijah would come again, it was more than  a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never  corrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought  that Jesus himself be he.';3

'Some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on numerology.  (Thats where you assign numeric values to letters and then add up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another.  I can never make any sense of how its supposed to work or what its supposed to prove.)  Somebody posted a long article about numerology in the Bible, saying things like "this proves the intricate planning of the Scriptures, else these patterns would not appear".  Then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the other numerology posts.  Stuff like "The word `numerology adds up to 28, and the word appears 28 times in the posting!  Such elegant planning! Further, the word `truth ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using these numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!"

'This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a  sharing on the "Johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of  the ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France.  NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP:  ==========================  soc.religion.taize (Unmoderated)   PURPOSE OF THE GROUP:  ====================  The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks  based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in  their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a  sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a  monthly "Johannine Hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each  month. A "Johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given Bible  passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that  may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be  posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less  in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another  to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own  life-journey.  The idea of "Johannine hours" was born in Taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bibles message in the midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence, we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of Christ.  During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we  understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions,  we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to  communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening  them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought  us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.  Perhaps those who read and think about the "Johannine Hours" in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.  The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.  BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY: =================================  The following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.  "A PARABLE OF COMMUNION": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring together a monastic community which would live out "a parable of community", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.  AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taizes founder spent the first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949, seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation. Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming people in Taize.  TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since 1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too small.  "A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH" The community has never wanted to create a "movement" around itself. Instead, people are called to commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood, their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created what it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". At the end of each year, the pilgrimage has a "European meeting" which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.  NOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in         news.groups.  For any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk                 brother.roy@almac.co.uk';3
'Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories.  There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same "errors".  This would appear to tell us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we dont know what they did before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.  Youre basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people like to use the game of "telephone" as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.';0

'(Deletion)   It has. There is a guy running around in Switzerland who claims to have been conceived similarly. His mother says the same. His father is said to be a bit surprised.   But anyway, there have been a lot of Messiahs, and many have had a similar story about their birth. Or their death. A list of Messiahs could be quite interesting.       I would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing evidence for everyone to check. And the whole question is absurd.   Wouldnt you feel bad if youd find out that stones are sentient, and that you have stepped on them all your life? And wouldnt you feel bad when youd see the proof that Jesus was just a plot of Satan?       Youve forgotten the pride factor.       The argument is a fallacy. It is like "thanks for reading this far" on the end of a letter. Most religions claim that they wont fizzle because they contain some eternal truth. So does Christianity. Since there are old religions it is no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last.';0
'Kent Sandvik and Jon Livesey made essentially the same response, so this time Kents article gets the reply:   This begs the question of whether it ever "started"-- perhaps because accuracy was always an intention.   It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away (reporters, if you will).  As I said earlier, the "telephone" metaphor is innately bad, because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts.  (Also, I would point out that, by the standards generally asserted in this group, the distinction between eyewitnesses and others is hollow, since nobody can be shown to be an eyewitness, or indeed, even shown to be the author of the text.)  There is no evidence that the "original" texts of either the OT or the NT are largely lost over time in a sea of errors, "corrections", additions and deletions.  In the case of the NT, the evidence is strongly in the other direction: the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more than a low level of significance.

'Its always a two-way street.  God gave her the grace to avoid sin, thus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total acceptance of Gods will.  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard  her as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that she accepted.  Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was neither stained by nor subject to original sin.  God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin. "Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to command it."  This amount of grace was precisely determined by God to be the amount required to do what God asked of her.  The grace given to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose to accept it.  We also believe Jesus was fully human and never sinned.    God could have created a much better person than myself, one who always chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite my flaws.  He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing me towards perfection.  For whatever purpose he has for me, he has confidence that I will accomplish it.

Lukes version has Jesus saying that the children of this world  marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I think the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Lets have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30, Mark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.  What happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to the "Leverite" marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.   The children would be considered children of the deceased, just as though the womans first husband had fathered them.  It seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask, "Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?"  At this point it seems obvious that if she is anybodys wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was refering to this when he says, "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures or the power of God." (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24, phrase not in Lukes account).  Anyway, the Sadducees ask, "Whose wife will she be in the resurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?"  Jesus answer is that, "In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage..." (Mat 22:30) "When they rise from the dead they neither marry..." (Mark 12:25)  "They which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry..." (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to say, "but are as the angels in heaven" or the equivalent.  I find this last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim that they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no Biblical support for this.)';3
'(stuff deleted)      [First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Josephs brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.]';3

'I suppose you dont know what about we have discussed. We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didnt tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. Theres no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.    Ok, youre writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesnt work, because theres no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I dont recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, theres need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user dont see full 24bit image, theres need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok, I dont have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...    It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesnt solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :)   Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to read it.';1
'Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she was just as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that mans nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16). In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human than any of the rest of us.     You ask why God cannot "repeat the miracle" of Marys preservation from Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ He not" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Marys salvation was obtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Marys salvation was obtained through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore, Christs Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and were necessary even for Marys salvation.';3
'A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a cyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection.  She was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all this time.  During her most recent doctors appointment at her parents HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney. When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldnt help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got worried. 	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April... She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to call back her doctors office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.

'Anton LaVeys interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I read his "Satanic Bible" a few years ago for a social studies project, as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called "The Cult of Devil Worship in America."  The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self.    When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I dont consider LaVeys church to be at all "orthodox," nor do I consider its followers "satanists."  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche, Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan. No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.  At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr. and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the  way.)    I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Websters Dictionary and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.';0

'I dont know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- "no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldnt find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldnt observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.    So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals dont do any better than sugar water --- then lets hear it.  If you dont, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative.    And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that its completely broken down in the guts, but this doesnt change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that doesnt establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If theres some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about.  But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

How about * The prophecy reveals Gods judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people (d) * That Gods judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that Citys special call, it still rejected Gods grace at the decisive time (Rev 11:8? - also isnt Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) * That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and is equally subject to Gods judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that weve created.

'But wouldnt that go for any sin.  My father told me when he was growing up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced. There are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce became acceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longer a sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each person has their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible" with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Bible warns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges, etc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who have given in to greed, get em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that he was the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust  Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?  Think about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and the Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees, hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins, those sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin are guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others are guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others of.

'Ive sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to  posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow Ive managed to  delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send  it back to me but hes pretty mad at me right now so Ill just retype it. Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all  day for that PMS post), Im not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has  them).  Im going to include some of the material from Weinsier and  Morgans new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to  point out that what Im going to say has some support in the medical  community.  Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long  time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and Ive  already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. Now Im going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in  the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).  When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as  the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have  decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C (which Ive already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is  also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if  vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  Its role in  both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).  Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and  beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and its toxic, beta-carotene  is the plant form and its completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other  tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human  adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We  are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about  30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they  were born with.  If you dont believe that nutritional reserves(like that  of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is  not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient  reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.  The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of  vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet  surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National  Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the  RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to  7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and its recommendations was  killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main  reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient  reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to  move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move  towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have  some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely  important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that  battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the  1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the  dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the  1940s(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill  the reserves).  We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a  normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient  reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how  much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has  overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol  level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your  liver with vitamin A and its time to stop taking retinol).  The normal  range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is  diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation  of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level  of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to  vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative  approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in  this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty  of warning that its time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache,  redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).  I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they  had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear  signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient  needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you  will always know when its time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for  PMS studies).  Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will  never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to  retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the  liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But  taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to  fill the liver up(Ive seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30%  that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One  other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not  convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the  enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of  retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will  cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.  Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body  uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be  nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the  retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses  retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells  and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes,  one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the  title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play  a role in infection(interferon production for example) but its biggest role  is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake  of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But  retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once  its formed, its used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC  group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDAs.  Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are  helping themselves.  If they dont have much vitamin A in their liver and  they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do  themselves more harm than good.  Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus  production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from  entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first  line" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown  to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which  stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration  and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters  are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not  normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process. This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials  in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.  Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that  vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who  walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be  worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already  has on its list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my  course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic  medical school in Tulsa(OUs branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.  Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night  vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The  serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver  reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have  trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled  out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels  were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below  20ug/dl.  As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of  the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably  see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low  serum retinol levels.  What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts from their book:  Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for  growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for  reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and  metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid,  which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not  in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A  status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal  range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are  indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater  than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation  tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to  perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to  vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The  bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal  tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than  7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts  over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation,  erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois (bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.    They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A  deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol  level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in  adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule  out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical  lab cant run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give  them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity  should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the  patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.  Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A. Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A. I dont suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to  fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the  serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the  vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a  demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will  provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status  are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more  agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But  vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could  become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human  fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is  18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on  the human fetus.  Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes  but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use  retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it  full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to  prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.s in this newsgroup  jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A  supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I  think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market  but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general  public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.';2
'Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio) June 25-27.  I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this year.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in apologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers, fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.     Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is available if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which has its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there for my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast, respectively.     Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from campus.     Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.     Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine:  Friday afternoon special:  Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper. Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the writings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis, and he has since edited 18 of Lewis literary works for publication. Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.  ---------------- Friday evening, opening session: In Search of the Truth: Finding the Fullness of Faith Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz.

'Ouch, this is a good question. To me, not existing is worse than existing no matter what, so I will modify this question to be: would I be a Christian if it made no eternal difference in my reward or punishment? I hope this is in the same spirit you want.  I personally am very goal oriented. It is hard for me to do things that do not achieve some goal. However, to relate this to sports,  only after I learned to not care about the score did I become a good basketball player. I had to learn to go all out no matter the situation. Perhaps this lesson is relevent. After all, only if I can give up my life can I keep it, only if I am humble can I achieve glory. Only if I concentrate on living my life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal. I think you have illuminated the true meaning of "saved by faith."  But what is my answer? Right now I would remain a Christian. However, was that always my answer? Thats the problem. Heaven and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity. And I admit there are certain times when perhaps I bite my tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day, i.e. I mentally trade present happiness for future happiness. I hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that than appropriate, but I am trying to be honest.   I think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. I guess it depends on how one views knowledge and learning. By stripping ideas to simple, straightforward, opposing concepts we can determine levels of importance. By analyzing the theoretically  absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd.';3

'As I dont know this book, I will use your heresay.   	It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them.  	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.   	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge, or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction.';0

'I agree, with the exception that I dont preach ignoring our cultures.   In Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one congregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in each city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they formed something of a stew, with different members having different heritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together, sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts.  Now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a common language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin was spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily Latin.  Naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language.  In the first century church, there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you dont see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called Pentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though -- bi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member - sometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet together on Sundays, there are headphones on people who dont speak English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue.  Neat idea, huh?  Now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays, so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish- speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those meetings.  As for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities.     The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of Latin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article.  However, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.  Ill assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.   You have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didnt.  Yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality "Christian" friendships outside your nationality (and your denomination).  We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.   It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going about things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist Episcopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.  I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that its hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to make it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity, would be taking the word "African" out of your denominations name.  Then perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "Methodist Episcopal" part also, and simply be part of "the Church".   There shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful in helping students new to America make the transition in culture, language, and thought.  We shouldnt make a new denomination to try to solve problems.  The whole denominational mindset only causes more problems, sadly.     Thank you for the invitation.  That shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage.  Thank you also for responding to my post.  I know (all too well) how they can be very time-consuming.  The whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions, but I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time.  My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post, yet doesnt limit expression of my Mexican culture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish (speaking) Zone.  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the Sunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples.  I dont believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because of my understanding of Biblical Christianity.  However, I am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesnt interfere with my normal worship.  Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  You can meet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass. Ave.) at 9AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day. My number is 225-7598, but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer.  Our service normally last from 10AM to noon, but occasionally are later or earlier (1-3 times per year).     Definitely!  Lets also strive to grow in obedience to the Lord through being men and women after Gods own heart.';3

'For a very long time Ive had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.  	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually felt refreshed the next morning.  	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didnt notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try.  	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.

The part I quote above seems to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when other means are not sufficient; I would say this is a stronger restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when justifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where a crime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testament interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that I would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a New Testament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whether the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that non-violent provisions do not. I dont believe it does, and I would certainly observe that in the USA, where you have the death penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in the UK, where we do not.';3

'Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life recently.  Gods experience of time is so completely different from our own, since He is both within and without it.  Using words like "foreknowledge" and "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing Gods perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no "before" when He did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives or a time when he could have "predestined" our actions.  In fact, since our understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our free will interacts with Gods control of the universe.';3

'Elisabeth, lets set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read  "The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing  by this "hated" book.  Its okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me? Elisabeth, Im going to quote from Zinssers Microbiology, 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species  colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly  thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.   Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic  mycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic  infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or  "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent  parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute  it.  What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic  infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial  competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida  blooms.  Let me quote from Zinssers again: "However, some factors, such as  the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to  both mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers  this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess that  your nutrition course does not, too bad.      My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you  noticed my faculty rank, Im a biochemist, not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinssers).  But, as you point  out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells,  pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist  and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, its a lot of  Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.  You know Elisabeth, I still havent been able to figure out why such a small  little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in  Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what  Ive said, that it will make sense.  Im not asking anyone here to buy into  "The Yeast Connection" book because I dont know whats in that book, plain  and simple.

'Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.  L.  acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily  responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of  the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.  bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are  much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told  me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several  different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasnt  told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative  anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a  chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria  around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal  region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida  blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from  the evil yeast blooms in the body.  Im not ready to buy that yet.  I do  believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower  colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the  competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked. Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get  rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A  supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the  good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the  pH to basically starve the candida out.';2

'Andrew - continuing the discussion on the Deuterocanonicals...   Arguably, it is both. Since authority is a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that, for example "Jesus is Lord" whether the world at large accepts the authority or not. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative content whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the heart of Pilates pragmatic question "What is truth?" to Jesus when our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus reply was to appeal to the authority of his Father) You also might like to consider the claimed authority represented by the statements "thus says the Lord" in the Bible, which claim to put across the exact words of God.  You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the "community of faith" - does something become truth because it is accepted? The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to Rev 22 came in.)   If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will cut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the book: Jesus standards were that "Scripture cannot be broken". Can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha? (ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written)   Does it have a subjective ring of truth about it - and does other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the authenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for example)   What this is getting at is the relationship between text and reader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should have the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this in Jesus quote: "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord". (Matt 4.4)   Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the Apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as widely used as the OT and NT.   Think about what I have said above. You may want to revise your conclusion. In addition think about other sacred writings, eg the Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would categorise them using the above principles. One word of caution - you may find some reflected glory in some of these books: in that the inspired quality may be derived from the Bible. Remember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel of light and quoting Scripture.   What were you thinking of?   Weve lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that the statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that the whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from man-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as Scripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16.';3

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus  expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this   recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus  does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in  patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune  responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and  CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never  intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.

In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific  activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which   may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4  binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added  safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts,  stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune  function.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was  chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first  phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.  ==================================================================     "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.  341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)        There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive  women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The  anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of  leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic   activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to  barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to  twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.   Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory  illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive  mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than  bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower  progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer  protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of  milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA  antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against  core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a  human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and  malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is  still the best food for infants, regardless of the mothers HIV status.   Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early  milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast  milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and   may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.  ==================================================================     "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journal  of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802   (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.)

The  researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and  attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients  with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis  was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the  dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the  medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug  abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.   There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124   were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients  identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either  homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the  remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was  reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence  of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single   evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence  analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients  were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV  transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting  in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et  al.         ================================================================                                    April 22, 1993         ================================================================    "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" Washington  Post (04/22/93), P.

People who contract TB usually  develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria  again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight  off a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes  Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in  order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to  use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB  bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County  Hospital  in New York.  ================================================================     "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.  341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)        There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive  women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than  bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower  progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer  protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of  milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA  antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against  core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a  human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and  malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is  still the best food for infants, regardless of the mothers HIV status.   Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early  milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast  milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and   may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.  ================================================================    "HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 957   (Duesberg, Peter)        Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the  hypothesis  that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a  hindrance to the  physiologically (AZT) and psychologically  (positive AIDS test) toxic public  health initiatives, writes  Peter Duesberg of the University of California-- Berkeley.  In the Lancets March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesbergs   hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to  AIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesis  that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.   The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy,  no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this  hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4   depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies  against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals  from Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesbergs drug- AIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug- free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT   use altogether.  To refute Duesbergs hypothesis Schechter would  have to  produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years  HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same  AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.   Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs  for 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg.  ================================================================    "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection"  Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.)        Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases  in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected  individuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions,  write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.   The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with  hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,   profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the  observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had  circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the  end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,  contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the   aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens,  homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.   These autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules and  may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires  (50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such   autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and  HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss  in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA  antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell  counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very   rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with  these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.         ================================================================                                    April 23, 1993         ================================================================     "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6    (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.)        Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United  States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants,  minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the  University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung  Association,  said, "Right now, its a big city problem, but potentially its   everyones problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected  with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their  immune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  Tammes, a Centers for  Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has  issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB  patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because  those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with  treatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public  health services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of  cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George   Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to  Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of  diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City  residents dont  complete therapy.  When TB patients dont finish taking their   medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more  expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to  treat.  ================================================================      "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern  Florida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol.  83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.)        The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in  southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write  Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.   The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal  Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual  transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users,  or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route  of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records  from social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually  transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor  was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a   standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were  reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission  categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the  percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties  between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to  heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men  and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of   heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after  adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the  national average, the researchers  conclude.

DeYoung                                Professor of New Testament                          Western Conservative Baptist Seminary                                       Portland, Oregon       Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex, specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the terms meaning to "active male prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation, namely "homosexuals."  More recently the definition "homosexual" has been opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term "homosexuals" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals.  A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only factor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses.  Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline (I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).                        *************************************                                     INTRODUCTION       Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or sodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous scrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly,  the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.       This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence to point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the modern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the ministry.';3
'A world creator god does, the moment it creates the world. And to sayi that you cant recall *anyone* is even below your usual standard of a"arguing".   My argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions, namely god is perfect, god is all-knowing god sets the rules. The rules dont work for whatever reason. Because of its omniscience, the god has known it. In advance.   (Deletion)   It is not a question of grammar, it is a question of modelling. Has been discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group. When A is contradictorily defined A does not point to an instance in reality. Unless there is more information in the definition of A that allows me to find it somehow. However, when the contradictory attribute is said to be essential, ie has not got that attribute => not the A I am looking for, I can conclude that A does not exist.

'Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).  You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example, but there are probably others.  Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.  The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:  1: How does it work?  2: What evidence is there?  The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I dont know about iridology, but Ive read a book on reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. (Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.)  The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.  The word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means "(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist".  BTW, the usual term is "herbalist".  Why use a different word?';2
'That is not an "atheism mythology" in any sense of the word. "Religious paradoy" would be significantly more appropriate.  	The 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I do know several "strong" atheists. I am sure that others do. I myself am "strong" in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any meaning. Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of  the viability of language, or in internal self contradiction.   	The concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy. They,  and I, exist.  	Your strawman is pointless and weak.  ---  Private note to Jennifer Fakult.

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort.  She had to ask the Lady several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest...  The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.  (Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water  flowing.)';3

'It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con- sciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it wrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the perceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty of translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been difficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are so often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed to feel that the return of the Lord was to be "very soon" in the sense of perhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of "very soon" has proven to be different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope time, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.  Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to happen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which was thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.  There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and sincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming  events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these  "apocalyptic" times.  The various predictions (Im talking about those that appear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com- pletely.  One has the feeling "something is about to start to get ready to  begin to commence to happen".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes, in interesting times.  As for how to discriminate, the Bible doesnt help much.  There is an Old Testament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That helps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth- quake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give specific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they are necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space.  For what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate  could see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that  it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti- cipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact a spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law, knowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered a priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in  the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can sympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same overwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled,  and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what  I had seen.

'Larry -  Thanks for the reply, but this isnt quite the same thing.  Like I said before,  I can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy  ceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all  four gospels record the first "breaking of the bread" in some detail.   Communion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my  opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of  the Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal  meals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during  communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact  hiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read  some of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all  bashful about describing what went on during communion.  Thats why it seems  funny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st  century Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they  are "too sacred."  - Mark';3
'I think I can explain the "missing part of a leaf" story.  I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian photograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of Kirlian photography.  "That particular photograph" ... ?  Thats right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of the book were inclined to disbelieve in it.    I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo. For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down between the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The "missing half" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind  after the first photo.  This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasnt there when it happened.';2

'Im looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is the following;  From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having its own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to its incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.

Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily explicable by this - one forgets the misses.  Consider your astrological forcast in the newspaper.  How many times have you said "Thats me" vs "Thats not me"?  Youll remember the hits, but the misses will be much more frequent.  On 10-May-93 in Re: How I got saved...         And what if, instead if being healed, your affliction got much worse and you ended up paralyzed?  Would you have attributed that to god as well? Or would that have been the work of satan?  If you believe that would have been so, why ONLY good from god, and ONLY evil from satan?  Couldnt the agony have come from god?  Think about what he did to poor Job!

'This is too often true.  Many people try to place this as a "higher" sin.  However...   A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider (active) homosexuality a sin.  I dont often see the attitude of "forgive me and I will try to change".  Instead I see "theres nothing wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who have an illness because you dont accept me".  Christians can and will accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.  Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with a desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  Its much less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in anger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after several years.';3

Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out certain flaws in the argument, and recently Professor C Anthony Anderson, of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps free of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in the original version.

'Okay, I see smilies, so this isnt supposed to be a serious post. On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind it. Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is  presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this  statement is worthless. Presuming the Quran is a perfect religious  text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for  disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.  Ive already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesnt presume anything about the Quran other than its having sufficient clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of Islam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.';0

'This is the most unmitigated bilge Ive seen in a while. Jim Brown obviously has possession of the right-wing token.   "In December, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq $100 million per day, and that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world. Iraq, he suggested, was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands, while the community of nations won every day -- with no taking of life or loss of life."  -- FCNL Washington Newsletter.

"Conservative", my ass.   BULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was "smart." The rest - thats 93% - was just regular, dumb ol iron bombs and stuff. Have you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a successful interception of a Scud was defined as "the Patriot and Scud passed each other in the same area of the sky"?  And of the 7% that was the "smart" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me here - that means 65% of this "smart" arsenal missed.   Prove it.

"California is spending more than $90 million annually on capital cases, and until this year hadnt executed anyone since 1972.  Texas, the national leader in the number of executions, spends an estimated $2.3 million per execution.  That compares to an average cost of incarceration in Washington state of $25,000 per maximum-security prisoner per year."';0
'Recently Ive come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts the immune system to a significant degree.  He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over $100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness.  If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, Id be very interested to hear about research and personal experience.

'If I prescribe itraconazole for a patients sinusitis neither the AMA, FDA, State Licensing Board, nor ABFP will be knocking on my door to ask why.  This is a specious argument.   Among other things, how to evaluate new theories and treatments.   Funny, I thought it meant "one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers" (Dorlands 27th).  Certainly more precision than conveyed by "chronic yeast".   The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representations is far more frightening.  It is fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it and the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner doesnt know so.  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency.   May I reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of non-scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out, they should learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and divisions.';2

'Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical  trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal  candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the  frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the  candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus  should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the  intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to  oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the  lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, Im really  amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.   The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all  conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if  conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard  medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very  important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria  after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason  to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply  and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).';2

'Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives.  I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet.  Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."  Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate Easau when Esau has done nothing bad?  I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example, consider the saying in Matthew 6:24   + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one  + and love the other, or....  Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take second place. In our original example, second place means that Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the Baptist:   + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.  I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently, neither did he (John 1:21).';3

'I disagree.  In the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own irrationality.  The individuals belief in some dogmatic religion is a  symptom of that irrationality.   Atheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between ones religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may be non-religious was a secondary point.    As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.  Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma: skepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that  wonderful little creature known as the "theory."  Many of us believe in the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this  theory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it "makes more  sense than...?"  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.    Well, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.    Ideally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge that scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some scientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof  for the theory.  Remember cold fusion?    Not really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome. My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was in Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up), and the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the number of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the number of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and you will see my point.';0

'I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are sufficiently sentient to have intentions.

The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery, though.  About asthma, thats a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival", *speculates* (and says its not proven), that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  Hes had many patients whove found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.  Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery, as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

'<:  ....other good stuff about the Drs idiocy  Ok, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER "Dr. Idiot" story.   I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was exhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.  AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as I like to refer to him) said, "Well, I am off duty now." (still staring between my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.  The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time  during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get there.  Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the next on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that it was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that fellows ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a few little minutes.    I have run into "Dr. Idiots", "Mechanic Idiots", "Clerk Idiots" and "Etc. Idiots" in my time, but this fellow I would like to have words with.';2
'> Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side. Some think  > it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows? Whatever the  > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity,  > yet does that make his epistles any less?  Paul mentions his "thorn" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2 Corinthians 12:7-9   + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of  + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of  + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three  + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;  + but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my  + power is made perfectr in weakness."  He does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral problem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He ordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and his signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says, "See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand," or else, "See what a long letter I have written with my own hand." If the former translation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters larger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the Galatians (4:13-15),   + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached  + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial  + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an  + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you  + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.  Perhaps this last line means simply, "You would have done anything for me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes)." But in that case, we would expect some wording like, "If I had needed them." "If it were possible" sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes.  William Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific suggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had a malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.';3
'[referring to Mary]  I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin. Was Mary fully human?  If it is possible for God to miraculously make  a person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole life, then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus?  Why cant God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?  I dont particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the perpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this concept of Marys sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it.';3

'Putting aside our substantial differences, Id like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain.  One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans.  She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago).  Anyway, Id like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery?

'The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible prohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight being offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my question in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting response based on Roman Catholic theology).  However, I think now that I can at least answer my first question. Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with ones aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society, that is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage (and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception. The trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular relationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to how they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but all the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why cant a man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is dead and that he has "married" her? How does this case differ from the *duty* to marry ones brothers childless wife.  Are these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps that God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable of understanding why.  P.S. Please dont bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe, as some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions. You dont know whether I am homophobic or not. You dont know me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic remarks.';3

'Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasnt dealt with 	CGM, ASN.1, CDA, DCA, SGML, or any one of a number of other 	very successful file format.

'Three possible results after interview: 1) rejection outright 2) acceptance outright 3) the infamous wait list...   If you are on a wait list, your entrance into medical school is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their acceptance.  This can happen as late as day -1 of starting classes.     You can always call the admissions office.  The secretaries should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your application.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries have more power than you might realize, and you never know- could be the dean of admissions answering the phone.   If you dont get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really* want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself; DONT be pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant other.    If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a big-shot famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, dont be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say no, sorry instead of the medical school saying no, sorry.  I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point.    Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you say it.  Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor in some area, dont be afraid to spend some time in further coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses, it usually shows.  Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also. Beware of resume padding; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out.  Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal of skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in applying to any program, medical or what-have-you.  Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, the waiting is the hardest part, at least emotionally. :)';2

'Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For    Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message?  Consequently, faith    comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word    of Christ."     So then we receive Gods gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the    gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing Gods word preached.  Kids    are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to    respond to Gods word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot    be raised in baptism to a new life.  Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and thats one primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the babys soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the child gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.     Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the    guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The    righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the    wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him."     If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesnt hold us guilty    for anyone elses sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.  Adam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was what Catholics call "sanctifying grace".  (In the New Testament, the word used for this is "charity".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace. He didnt lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole human race.  Because once he lost it, he couldnt pass it on to his descendents.  Thats why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ instituted Baptism to give it back to everyone.';3

Generally, if one has a  pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy even when he dreams.  Dreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.    Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be careful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else. Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE might actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE. In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught up into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really leave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a spirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I dont think it matters that much.  Paul could not tell.    Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan to experience OOBEs.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a  place until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His own sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are just taken up by Gods sovereign will, and not because they are seeking an OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lords day when he was caught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one time.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it. People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits for the sake of a few thrills.';3

'Id like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ, my experiences with religion havent been all that positive.  In fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply _couldnt_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the troubles Ive had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God.  The first category doesnt occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time) would fail.  The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my  life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor have I ever been, "on fire for Chirst," and I dont think I ever want to be. Nevertheless, I am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so I dont really fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right, but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal strife, theres atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no responsibilities, no need to live up to anyones expectations but my own. Complete freedom.  Of course, its all an illusion, but nevertheless, its a very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of God" are behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.  IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God wasnt a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what- youre-told-because-we-know-whats-best-for-you-because-its-Gods-will-and- youre-to-young-to-know-what-Gods-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of Christs more overzealous followers.    A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world, Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldnt sacrifice to the emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of  their own moral view.  There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I dont have time to go into them right now.';3
'Thanks for the letter, your comments helped some.  As to the last comment, I certainly realize that it was not intended to sound that way.  I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being colud truly be one and three at the same time.  All of the descriptions of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of, "they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are one, trust me").  Neither of these is acceptible to me.  The fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any *sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as Modalistic Monarchianism or "Economic Trinitarianism".  [I can accept that the three aspects are intrinsic to the nature of God, so I perhaps lean more towards the latter].  I am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description that is both orthodox and believable.  --  sarima@teradata.com			(formerly tdatirv!sarima)   or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com';3

'(deletion)     Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. The point is that theism is *a* factor.       Thats a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.       Thats a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.   Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.     And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.       Thats bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.   Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular.       Ive been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here.   An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived. "I exist" is derived, if you want it that way.   Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.   what is it you are trying to say?       Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or the way the world works.       Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed) says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can have interesting effects.';0

Ablex Publishing Corporation is planning a special volume on "Shape Analysis", scheduled for this year.  This volume will be a part of "Progress in Neural Networks," an annual book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.  Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling, shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching, surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.  The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably, but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length.

'This sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism (in the the three phases of water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff). It certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position.  [Of course, I suppose that the medieval view of water may have been different, but now we know that the phases of water are just different *behaviors* of the same physical stuff - different modes, not different identities - but perhaps the medieval people did not know that].

'Regarding the consequences of the original sin:  Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for himself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically a share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk: what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar. It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the New Testament speaks of.  What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.  The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that its impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.  This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since both have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot enter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they cannot enter into Heaven.  Turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the Catholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some change in an infants soul, there is no particular reason to insist on the practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the Apostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly thereafter.';3

'I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I got pneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch to Mevicore.    On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108,  and HDL was 35; but the trigs were still very high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal,  SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).  He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Just to be extra cautious, though Im sure its not a problem."), and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice, and he said that he wouldnt object if thats what I want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect Im not fond of.';2

Yet, this opinion is formed without recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context, accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this book contains and what the authors motivations are.

'I posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity".  I now think it more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.       Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So, you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your body.       "Shiver" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body experience?';2

'I dont agree, but I can only speak for myself.  I have a good friend whose lifestyle is very sinful.  Do I hate the things she does to herself and others?  Yes.  Do I hate her?  Absolutely not.  In fact, she tells me repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care about her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life.  Its very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  Ive felt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important  part of Christianity that youve overlooked above and makes it possible to "love the sin but hate the sinner."  Before I look at someone elses life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see in *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness is contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you describe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, "Wretched man that I am!" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin.  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee  who said, "I thank Thee that I am not like other men..." [Luke 18:11 (NASB)], we will hate both.    -- Scott at Brandeis';3

'Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creators  	Contest Announcement)  WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?  ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer  peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that  uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to  a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR  gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality,  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: =====================================  ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware  protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing,  framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running, without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards, locators, and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and  Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples  of the interface from applications to the device drivers.   To Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):';1
'I am writing this to find out the following:  1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.  2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.  3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.  My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with  reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he  saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta,  Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.   These treatments were not effective and because the damage was  worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told  there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen  wrap and a "Hill Repair".  He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recovered  very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse  and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).  The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him  that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition  which he called "Barretts Syndrome". If he cant avoid having reflux will  he necessarily get cancer?  Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, Id  appreciate it.  Thanks,';2
'I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I dont think Plato would have been happy with this, and neither would Paul, although Pauls ideas were quite different. However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements.  The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I dont believe in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.   Ah, you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed all along.    You might be as well planting Satans seeds, ever thought of this? Besides, you havent yet explained why we must believe so blindly, without any guiding light at all (at least I havent noticed it). I dont think this is at all fair play on gods part.   Your argument sounds like a version of Pascals Wager. Please read the FAQ, this fallacy is discussed there.   And I failed to get help from the HS because I had a wrong attitude? Sorry, Dan, but I do not think this spirit exists. People who claim to have access to it just look badly deluded, not gifted.   Petri';0
'We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated  and ones that will give prettier images.  Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are  going to present a paper titled "Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains" which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS93  conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape  with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be  presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.  We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs,  and terrain elevation maps (DTM).  Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.  If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us directly :  amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)';1
'I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,    an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.    Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.     The following is the relevant sections from the man page.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)  NAME    bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations  DESCRIPTION   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.    As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the   many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The   SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size.    As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of   input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).    Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image.  FEATURES    Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,    the processed image will be displayed.    Current features include    o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing     and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.    o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with     the option of subpixel sampling.    o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text     strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.    o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.    o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished     rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-     lability of graphical histograms of the image.    o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-     gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,     PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions     independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle).    o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-     to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.    o Performs histogram equalization.    o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of     arbitrary order.    o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.    o Cuts and pastes across images.    o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.    o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images. (SlideShow)    o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities     or as an intensity vs. distance plot.    o Performs image type conversions.    o Converts image formats.    o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).    o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it.    o Modify an individual pixels RGB values.    o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra.    o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).   SUPPORTED FORMATS       o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS       o  JPEG(JFIF) format       o  CompuServ GIF       o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.       o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)       o  TIFF       o  PostScript(Write only)  Hardware requirements: ---------------------------------------------------------------    Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.

'I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the "homosexual"  issue and the "atheist" issue. Please take no offense at these comparisons.  The homosexual "feels" things that I admit I do not "feel".  He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences. That is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his situation. Models that do not match up with what he knows he feels will be discarded. However, one wonders if once accepting the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on  the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates his model.  If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.  The Christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not feel. The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true description of what his feelings mean. Once accepting this model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model which of course validates his Christianity.  As a reminder, I am a Christian, a Catholic, I dont hate  homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand them. I only compare them because they are both so foreign to me. Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems blind to me? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against  attempts by society to deny his sexuality?  Or am I just out to lunch, again?';3

'I dont have a stat, but, unfortunately, I did read generally that both smoking and belief in the supernatural (occultish garbage) is on the rise here.    This is very interesting.  I thing the principle is sort of the same though: all "philosophical" ideas are generally tried out and tested mostly during college years.  Whether the idea is christian or atheist doesnt always matter. But Id like to say its because atheists are more intelligent  :)   --   regards,  --Adam';0

'"CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS"                                     by: Hank Hanegraaff             "Controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin.             Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command."                                        -Dr. Walter Martin   Dr. Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him as President of the Christian Research Institute -- the largest  evangelical counter-cult organization in the world. In this skillful,  careful treatment of an explosive subject, Hanegraaff documents and  examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly  compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian  faith. For the first time ever, this large and influential movement is legitimately labeled as cultic.  In this book, Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith  movement as E.W. Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of "another gospel"  (Gal 1:6-9) (Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Frederick K.C. Price, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Paul (David)  Yonggi Cho, Charles Capps, Jerry Savelle, Morris Cerullo, and Paul and  Jan Crouch).  The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should be in most Christian Book Stores soon.

'This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is _not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done.  But I dont really think thats what hes saying anyway.  See below.      What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that a certain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the same as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better comparison would be to indentured servitude.  I dont really want to get into a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your point, I dont think it is relevent, because the original poster did not say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not immoral.     Back to the original posters assertion.  He is not in fact making the logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven. _Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the contrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we baptize infants.     To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something is not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if something cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be asserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_, using the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are theories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually proving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling into is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is false.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.     I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism, although the evidence seems to me to favor it.';3

'FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE            The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24           in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-           laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-           GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-           tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was           represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS           users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-           dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and           academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS           users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS           standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS           implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,           described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond           PHIGS".            Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following           topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,           Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented           Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS           Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and           Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed           a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The           conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-           ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools           based on PHIGS.            Next years conference is planned for March, 1994.            PHIGS EVERYWHERE            At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated           PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to           mainframes.            Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including           conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing           and translucency.            Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-           Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add           advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like           ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.           Radiosity support is also planned.            FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging           graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate           mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase           and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.            TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful           "2-call"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-           oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.            G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on           Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-           sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the companys  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-           tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS           developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS           internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data           Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS           for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described           their application GSE that allows application callback  functions           during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5Gs data visual-           izer and application development toolkit, are currently available           on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or           Starbase.            Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows           and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most           of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many           advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-           tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS           or ARENA is available on request.            ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-           tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most           workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-           porates PEX support.            Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital           Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the           DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.           DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with           support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most           GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as           proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and           the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340           workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.            Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A           Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics           PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-           ments.             PHIGS USER GROUP            The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS           applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and           PHIGS standards bodies.

'Friends unpleasant experience uring CT scan deleted  Id suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the hospital administrator. Specify the date and time. If possible the names of the technicians.   Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was admitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argument with the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignore complaints until the patient becomes litigious. Clinicians may not have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find themselves named in a suit.  If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter. Attach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you do get a response.  CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting study in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would never have another. This compares with 15% who said the same about a lumbar puncture.';2

'David Hammerslag asked:  	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage 	with Christs statement that in the resurrection people will 	neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?  Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed, but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less one of the following three positions:  (1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying     to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa-     tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they     didnt believe in).  These people -- and those associated with them     ("Now there were with us seven brethren", Matt. 22:25) -- would not     be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,     the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-     ties; but that doesnt mean other, more faithful people could not     have this blessing.  (2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of     =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter     activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in     the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of     before then.  (3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is     missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note     that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in     general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with     modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-     ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question     was not significantly revised in the "Joseph Smith Translation" or     "Inspired Version" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work     was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-     stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.';3

I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from  local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the  bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us  compliments of the Dairy Industries.  There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive  financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous   benefits of increasing ones calcium intake.   Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved   in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study  didnt say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large-  ly calcium."  Perhaps it wont be long before another study comes up with the exact  opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they  are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldnt be the first time.    Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still   the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention   of kidney stones.  I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in  ones diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney  stones of either type; and they definitely wont include an INCREASE  in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium  type and peoples chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit  from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

'Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of Christianity/churches there are.           My husband and I come from very different, but completely Christian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a born and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot of what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based. However over the last year, Ive been regretting changing to the Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are socio-cultural in nature and dont relate to the Christian doctrine. One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through Mary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that verse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men (ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study. Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you arent a conservative republican - you arent a REAL Christian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call themselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are also dont agree with the C of Cs dread of any new "movement" being led by the young people.  So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women). Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their Bibles to service.  We are so confused here and were drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction wed be thrilled! Im afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and even harder for me to stay churchless for long.  any responses would be welcome   the diel family';3

'I have enrolled in "The History of Christianity" at a college here in St. Louis. The teacher of the class is what I consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of Christianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the Trinity and the Catholic churchs definition of it and belief in Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call ones self a Christian.  While his saying it doesnt make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted (or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student-teacher relationship.  So, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the previous discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames.  Regards, -- Larry Autry Silicon Graphics, St. Louis autry@sgi.com     [Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the  broadest, commonly used definitions are:    a historical definition   people who accept Christ as Lord and savior   a broad doctrinal definition   narrow doctrinal definitions  1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use.  This would include any group that developed out of the Christian church, and continues within the same broad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet its clear that that group developed from Christianity, and people from very different backgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of Christianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but its relevant in some political and ethnic contexts.  2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many Christian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and Presbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  Its an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the modern context this would include Mormons, JWs, and "oneness Pentecostals".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the Apostles Creed.  3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition, which includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes groups that are felt to be outside "historic Christianity."  This is of course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that Protestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree are key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance.  4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited to a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style conversion experience, and some Ive even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church.  I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used. A lot is going to depend upon the purpose youre using it for.  If youre using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, youll probably use definition 1 or 2.  If youre using it normatively, i.e. to say what you believe the Christian message is, youll probably use a definition like 3 or even 4.';3
'A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.  I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her.  To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may have a deadly disease, and next thing you know youre being put into this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation.  Is there anything I can do about these pigs ?  I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that sort of thing.  They dont need this kind of shit.

'This is something Ive always found a little curious. Ive never quite understood the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But, at the same time, he is Gods son "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could he really be Gods son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak, then it seems that Jesus relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the fathers  qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that case, Jesus and God arent the same. On the other hand, if their relationship isnt the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God incarnate, then hes not really Gods son and he never was. Hes just God manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how Im seeing it. Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us?   Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more. The fact that Jesus was Gods only begotten son doesnt seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ. But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.   [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together. First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this group, its dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is Gods son in a physical sense, with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin Birth says that Jesus birth is Gods responsibility.  But it doesnt imply that Gods sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that God used Josephs genetic material.  Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is a part of God.  The Son didnt come into existence with Jesus birth. Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isnt specifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, its the Son who was incarnated.';3
'Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while she was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)?  OFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on innocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a persons sin for several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal abuse just to name three.  So, Gods definition of fair and ours differ.  Some points of perspective:  Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Websters first definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in their shoes. I know myself pretty well, and Im just not that good. Take Gods word for it, neither are you. "There is no one righteous..."  More important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical selfs sinful tendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help. (Rom 7,8)  "...God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes." -Eccl  Mark';3
'Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling between some software cracks...   [Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an  apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldnt actually  have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesnt matter to what  follows]  I dont know whether Im quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back to current affairs,   Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you will, known (according to Umar Khan) to "Every Muslim school boy and girl", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.   Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing the actor "Gibreel" in the role of the angel whose name he took. Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened.  Its somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer, consider Salman Rushdies childrens book "Haroun and the Sea of Stories" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific storyteller -- works with existing story lines.   No.  Muhammads [Mahounds] integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story, and theres no reason to think this was Rushdies intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and satanic), though he doesnt know their provenance.  It is not implied (in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:      " *Not my voice* Id never know such words Im no classy speaker     never was never will be but this isnt my voice its a Voice.       Mahounds eyes open wide, hes seeing some kind of vision,     staring at it, oh, thats right, Gibreel remembers, me.  Hes     seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Dont     know, cant say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my     mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.       Being Gods postman is no fun, yaar.       Butbutbut: God isnt in this picture.       God knows whose postman Ive been."  Its ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan? Or something else?  The answer is not given.  To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation, but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very existence of a newsgroup named "alt.atheism" raises the same questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is the real relevance.  If Rushdies mild fictional exploration is "filth and lies", and he "asked for what he got", are we next on the fatwa list?  (Thats a rhetorical question, of course.) --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.  For a nominal fee, they can be yours.';0
'[deleted stuff from Andrew wrt which atheist myth is Bill re: to]  "Counterfeit atheists". Hmmmm. So, were just cheap knock-offs of the True Atheists.   Religion demonstrates itself to be absurd. Constantly. Personally, if  someone asks, Im happy to point out how this is so.    Man, what *is* your pill wrt atheists? If youre going to make such contentious statements, back them up! At least, READ NEWS: time-and-time again, weve hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold.  Try debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like,  "...more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist." Then take a look at the responses weve given Tammy. Seem pretty "reasonable", nay, even "polite" to me.   [accusations of myths a-flyin]  I saw your reference to "According to" in the original article. Then you do such an excellent job of spewing dogma that, well, the implication was pretty clear (if wrong, in this case).  [jeez, a misunderstanding. Let it go.]  [more statements to wrap this thing up]  If you had WRITTEN your post with the same as care as the FAQ has been, we wouldnt be having this discussion.  [gems about evidence deleted]   Jeez, do I have to point this out to you? This discussion is not all instances of human reason. Therefore, your implication is false.    How lame can you get. Who said anything about the truth of things? Read the FAQ very carefully, please. Then report your findings about where it says the purpose of a.a is to find the truth of things.

'When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection  incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest  that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial  because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and  mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).   Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.   Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses  mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline  with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression  but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.   Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good  bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects  of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the  medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects  of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).    Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my  opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is  normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many  infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some  physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection  frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to  result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the  length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms  associated with the infection.   There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong  immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C,  vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this  is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low  and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune  response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are  distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of  these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe  infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A  status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for  vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five  nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the  others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what Ive worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the  critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also  be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a  nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and thats  what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves  nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training  needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good  for getting general dietary advice from however.';2
'Archive-name: atheism/overview Alt-atheism-archive-name: overview Last-modified: 20 April 1993 Version: 1.3                                     Overview  Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a controversial nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet" and "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.  If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "Finding Stuff" section below.                                      Credits  These files could not have been written without the assistance of the many readers of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you cant find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you dont find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isnt set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and youll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you dont have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    Theres other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and    "send atheism/index".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if youve tried the above methods and theyve failed; its not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or peoples mailboxes with requests for files.    its better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who dont have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.';0

'If you were to start your own religion, this would be fine.  But there is no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to the heart of the problem.

'"Im afraid Im going to have to kill you.  Dont worry, though; as a Loving Christian, I guarantee that I will regret the fact that I have to kill you, although I wont regret the actual killing."   False dichotomy.   Thats because they werent even attempted.   You want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of WW2, when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary?   And why-is-it-that-way?  Who set things up to be that way?   No, just the ones that have oil.  Or the ones that look like they might make a success of Communism.   I dont see that getting UN forces to East Timor is any harder than getting them to Iraq.   Fine.  Write to your Congressman and to President Clinton.  Chinas status as "Most Favoured Nation" comes up for renewal in June.  Point out that the US shouldnt be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime.  I doubt anything will happen.

The ends justify the means, eh?   The same tired old misunderstanding.  Moral relativism means that there is no *objective* standard of morality.  It doesnt mean you cant judge other peoples morals.  Christ on a bike, how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head?   Obviously not, as I am an atheist.  I dont think youd get on with Jesus, though; he was a long-haired lunatic peace-nik, was he not?   Right.  Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.  I think youre being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people.   Oh, come on.  With wars like the Falklands fresh in peoples minds, that sort of propaganda isnt going to fool anyone.   Yes?  And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered?  Its hardly surprising the US didnt lose many men in WW2, given that you turned up late.';0

'I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeast connection".  But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime, Id still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT says "sorry, youll just have to live with it", it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  Im glad I did this, since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.

'molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.   While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing.   This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment.   Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological            sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art            computer graphics into their research; computer scientists            wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of            scientific visualization.

'RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992  		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE  I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC  	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  Tribulation.  "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be  saved." - Matthew 24:13  II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION  	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christs second coming.  Also know as "the time of Jacobs (Israels) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniels Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.  III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM  	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community  (the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable  possession during the Tribulation.  IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24,  Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you.    V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray  and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ.    VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS  	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell, or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be useless.  "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and  slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast,  or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666" - Revelation 13:16-18.   	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past, such as the Holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -M] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrists rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of  them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer,  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11. 	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of  God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children,  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark.   	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire. [Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M] You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire.  "...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His  indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation  14:9-10   [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --M]   VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL  	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrists government until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake. 	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the Antichrists control will come last to the least populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation. ["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings" --M]  Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [Get a good water filter. --M] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights, batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.  VIII. TRUST NO ONE 	 	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrists government.  Be on the lookout. [Perot supporters take note --M]  IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST  	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be  physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and  personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived. [Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M] 	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.   All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.  X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!  	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you  will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.   	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of  your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death."  	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!  ****************************************************************************** Mike Cluff				*  "Christianity is Stupid. v22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms	*   Give up." -Negativland UB Language Perception Laboratory	*   ******************************************************************************   /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.';0

'Heres a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ.  I dont think its covered, though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used:  How about it, mathew?  INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE  This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying "see, the source really does say B, its right here!"; this reply does not refute the allegation of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.  Example of the first type: "The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in these ways.  We can both agree these are immoral."  "The Koran clearly says in this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way."  Example of the second type: "There are two Biblical creation stories."  "Youre wrong, since the Bible clearly describes the creation as [description]." -- "On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...  Leftover Turkey!

'The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the sisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris.  Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5 or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light.  The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining to her life and to the future of France and the world.  On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed her to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this  medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would receive great graces. In less than a year there were three more apparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports were received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing the medal was known as the "Miraculous Medal". Catherine died in 1876. Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was canonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with Our Lady.  The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor. Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent Gods all knowing wisdom looked down on them. Our Ladys feet rested on a white globe and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was stepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world. Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed  Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword represented her suffering with Jesus.  The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned that a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition  leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets. And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute with the forces of the dark. She told Catherine "The times are evil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be overturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all kinds."  Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Ladys messages. A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.  I will post other Marian events every few days or so including the ones happening today which are still under investigation. These postings serve only to introduce you to these events. Please look more into them and understand the reason for  the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.  --';3

'Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary "After The War" is my main source.

You may claim that sanitation plants are strategic "legitimate" targets, but what happens to the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals cant handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

We have all, Im sure, seen Postols interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about the Patriots effectiveness; what is your source for the 70% effectiveness you claim?

'I certainly agree with the last paragraph.  Also, Jesus;s statements on hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as was much of his other teaching.  Theres more than enough hell here on earth that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesnt mattter to me.  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift God offers.

'"Liberate" is the way an invader describes an invasion, including, if Im not mistaken, the Iraqi liberation of Kuwait.  Never invaded Nicaragua?  Only with more word games: can you say "send in the Marines?"     Oh, good: word games.  If you let the aggressor pick the words, theres scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action.    Thats a convenient technique, much seen on alt.atheism: define those who disagree with you according to a straw-man extreme that matches virtually nobody.   Very noble and patriotic.  Im sure the fine young Americans who carpet-bombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon, destroyed Iraqs sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the sky or further, or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their trenches [or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to] were just thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the defense of the liberty of ... well, wealthy Kuwaitis.  Cant have those oil-fields under a tyrants heel if that tyrant is antagonistic to US interests...    Having pigeon-holed "peace-niks" (in this context, "people who disagree with me about the conduct of the Gulf War") into "peace-at-all-cost-hitler-supporting-genocide-abetting-wimps", you can now express righteous indignation when "they" refuse to fit this mold and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms.  HOW DARE THEY!   Yes, hypocrisy indeed!  Those violent peace-niks!  (Care to list an example here?)   Wow: instant 80s nostalgia!

'Just a quick comment.  As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and they seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  The pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.  We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God might work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or two.  Baptist believe in regenerate membership.  Did this church include these half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?

'From Bit.listserv.christia  Zane writes...   From: FACN34B@SAUPM00.BITNET (zane of dhahan) Subject: Christianity in Crisis Date: Wed May 12 14:43:19 1993   "Frank, first of all, thanks for all of the great Scripture verses.  It was a pleasure to read them."   MY REPLY... You are welcome, Zane.   Zane... "I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you. I mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you have read the book youve been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your Christian life?"   MY REPLY... (1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith     movement.  It was easy.  I wasnt grounded in the Word of God and sound     doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I     could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.     Consequently, I began receiving Hagins monthly magazine (and they     still send it to me), and also Copelands (also, still sent to me).     It wasnt until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:     The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were     partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying     more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my     experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that     these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in     Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!   (2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith "cult" in my area - its     leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into     much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and     has now fallen into atheism.  Im still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).   (3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been     a `follower of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the     Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers     heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, Ive been able to talk     to him at length about these issues.   (4) The leader of the Womens Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan.     Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to     women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as     my lending CIC to people in the church.   Im well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies. What heresies?     A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became         one with him.     B. Jesus death on the cross wasnt enough to atone.     C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by         Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling         over Him there.     D. Jesus was `born-again in hell.     E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after         the resurrection.     F. We are gods.   These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings upon request.   Zane... "Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word/faith movement which youd been contemplating joining for so long, but now that youve read the book, youve been saved from all of that?"   MY REPLY... It wasnt _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by Swaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous documentation and insights.   Zane... "I dont have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un- profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting."   MY REPLY... Why do you call it "heresy hunting"?  "Hunting" implies it isnt readily accessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in Christendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesnt sound like much "hunting" is needed.   It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before. More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal, practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy.  Its not a new thing.  Remember Luther?   Zane... "I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un- documented opinion."   MY REPLY... (1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated. (2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes     disunity and immaturity in the body.   EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting....   Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isnt caused by exposing error; its caused by error.   Zane... "There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as documenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would suggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End."   MY REPLY... Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Lets examine his admonitions to Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...   2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.   2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.   2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.   2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.   2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.   2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.   2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.   Zane... "The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears, the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves."   MY REPLY... ACT 20:26-31 "Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. "For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. "Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. "For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. "Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. "Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.   Zane... "For all the warning Paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf....  - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him - everyone in Asia wasnt it ?"   MY REPLY... Paul mentioned names...   1TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.   2TI 1:15 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.   2TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.   2TI 4:10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica--Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia.   2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.   So did John...   3JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church.   Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines...   REV 2:14-16 "But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality. "Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.   REV 2:20-23 "Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. "And I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent. "Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. "I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.   Zane... "I question too, the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others.  Maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey, or barely cakes...with no worldly goods at stake, money to be made, or no reputations to maintain... I would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less."   MY REPLY... I wont comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others. But even if they had bad motives, remember what Paul said...   PHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.   Zane... "If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which you list - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines, I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the Cross."   MY REPLY... Please explain.   Zane... "Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships - which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church."   MY REPLY... If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is being taught not just in Copelands church or Hagins or Hinns or Prices, but all over the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church.  Its imperative that leadership be made aware of this, and CIC does just that.   Also, lets examine a passage of Scripture... * EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, * EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,   These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church, but for "the body of Christ". Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also a teacher - 1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church. 1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.   Also - 1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.   * EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;   Notice that the "Five-Fold" ministries are going to be around "till" the church is in "unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see 1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders maturity and unity of the body?   * EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,   Its clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church "by the trickery of men" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are "tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine".   The "Five -Fold" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear Scriptural denominational boundaries ("pastors" appear responsible for their individual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their struggle to equip the body.   All believers are called to do this to a degree... JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.   Zane... "If youll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to Church and area to area, were the "bad guys" and they went after the "good guy" namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic."   MY REPLY... They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught!   Zane... "Lets face it, the wolves are here for a reason.  And we are here for the Reason.  And lets hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs."   MY REPLY... Yes! 2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,                                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~ God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.   AMEN!   Frank';3
'That depends on how this verse is read.  There are at least two meanings of the word "once".  1) only one time, and 2) at some other time (i.e. once upon a time).  Note that in the previous verse, the word "once" is used with the second meaning, and also in the following verse, "once" is again used with the second meaning. The Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings for the English word "once".  I am not a Greek scholar, but Im sure someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning. If the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as:    - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with Adam), but      after this [gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ] the judgement     [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life     with Christ.';3

'I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others may not have the reference.  "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents."  What is "the sin" of the parents?    Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle. However, it assumes that fathers and sons have  equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.  Parents are responsible to teach their children the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their  children, the parent would be held responsible -- not for their childrens sins, but for not teaching them properly.  Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position  of authority in either the family or the church He expects that person to teach those in his charge.  In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others  is likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel." "If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from  his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to  turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."  Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with "parents have children in Zion" I believe all parents are responsible for teaching their children  whatever good principles they understand. However, LDS parents accept greater responsbility and could be judged more strictly.';3

'Why shouldnt I mind? It sounds as if you are proceeding with just the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of. I always preceeded my statements with "it is my understanding that..."

After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.   I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and  other such opaque "concepts" often used by people to camoflage the  baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology. These are just the sorts of "concepts" used by Christian churches the perverting of their religion.    Alaikum Wassalam,';0

'I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.    First of all, Ive tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; its possible to give  succinct answers to most everything, but theres enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours, Im sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean  it) is great, but its also important for me to have as broad a base of  individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- its a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.    Secondly, I hope some of the questions dont come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact, Im not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- its easier  than just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time.    Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system" although I know some of you might contend that you dont have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.    ---------------  Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum  	Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?   Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.     In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe  in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume  that the answer to this is "yes;" if youve always been an atheist, or at least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)   How serious was your/your familys involvement?    How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?    How and when did your "final break" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I  realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an "event" per se; whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.     What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?     To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the  plausibility of Gods existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new "secular religion," and that "scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood."  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?)    ---------------  This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.    ---------------  Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what Im doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what Ive asked about above.';0

'I have been studying the Bible now for about a year.  I love it, but I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or traditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups. I have heard various people (outside this news group) describe *idols* such as power, money, material  possessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I  suppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...    I have been reading the postings in this news group (which I  just found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, Im not trying to question anyones belief or try to push my views on anyone else (I havent been at this long enough to have any views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good, I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that I could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that every time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in Christs side because He took the punishment for my sins, when He died on the cross).  In my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is,  but thats about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary  could be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?  It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself Im sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about Tongues (Im reading "Charismatic Chaos").  I guess Ill study Tongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can  give me will be appreciated.      -------------------------------------------  [I dont think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a different tradition than yours.  This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics generally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The issue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine. Since this isnt in the Bible (except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they didnt already believe it), Protestants dont accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the Church, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.  I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of course a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally consider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and various subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, its a matter of how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those who dont.  There are also a number of major historical traditions, but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  Id  identify the major Protestant traditions as:    Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (theyre sort of halfway between   Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,   Church of Christ  But there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical" perspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still quite marked.  I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and give a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately Im away from my library at the moment, so I dont have anything specific to recommend.';3

'The OTIS Project presents...         SYNERGY: Revolt  	...the first in a continuing series of collaborative 	art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity 	of the infosphere.  This series of diversely  	structured art-manipulation projects will attempt 	to stretch across network boundries encouraging 	use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography, 	scanned "conventional" art and even sound to  	create multi-artist "still" visuals in GIF and  	JPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels 	are welcome.    	REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be  	three stages of production.  The first stage will 	consist of all participants creating one still  	work as a "starter" piece that two other partici- 	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage 	"base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993,  	midnight Central Daylight Time.   	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will  	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant 	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see  	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist 	of filtering the image through their favorite paint 	program.  For "analog" artists, this may well be 	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their 	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan- 	ning in the image again to be transferred on to  	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works 	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.  	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin 	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think  	it takes to finish up the image theyve been given 	using whatever technique they see as worthy.   	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.

'This response originally fell into a bit bucket.  Im reposting it just so Bill doesnt think Im ignoring him.   Bill,  Im sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this.  Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism neednt imply materialism, or the lack of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and dont believe in absolute morality, so Ill answer your questions.   An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality.  That I dont believe in an absolute one doesnt mean that I dont have one.  Im just explicit, as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I object to genocide, Im not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds.  If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving considerable survival advantages.  Youd probably say that God just made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early childhood teaching.   I think youve been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what youre saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as "God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites" is mechanistic, but of course I think thats true of you as well.  My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him good, which is supposedly an attribute of God.   Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with, and say "this is good", even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as "excluded from discussion", such that they "cannot participate", and their opinions given "no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form or reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort of someone who cant rationally defend their own ideas of right, wrong, and the Bible. --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by anonymous FTP indefinitely.       The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine & Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit, but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process.       This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word, theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local computer support person.

'Fred Gilham asks (May 11) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God.  Yes, he did. He did not publish it, but it will be published by the Oxford University Press in German and with English translation in Volume 3, due to appear this fall, of his Collected Works.  Meanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an article by Jordan Howard Sobel called "Goedels ontological proof" in the book ON BEING AND SAYING, edited by Judith Jarvis Thompson (sp?), published by the MIT Press in 1987.  Professor C Anthony Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota has written an article, "Some Emendations of Goedels Ontological Proof," which appeared in the magazine FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY, v. 7 (1990): 291-303. It discusses some objections that various critics have raised against Goedels proof, and offers a revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these objections.';3

'Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who dont treat and quacks who treat. Ones that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.  There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.   There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.   Sometimes its hard to tell whos who.    Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon.   Arguments abound when there arent any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses arent, or cant, be diagnosed or treated. But I think its better to argue against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someones competency. And you cant convince everybody.   Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they dont run into a doctor who recognizes the disease, they havent developed something recognizable yet, or they have something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasnt been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out, sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment, sometimes they find its incurable.    There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an  illness. Unless its a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease its is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.';2

Im not sure what you mean by this.  What do you think youre paying for? Youre not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a doctors appointment.    --';2

'Yes, but no more than he is worth. :-).  Seriously: Jerome is merely (and grandly) another Christian witness, to be taken for what he can tell us.  He is one in the community of saints.  You seem to wish for a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant thought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid. To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant aspects of) Roman thought.  Other than some peoplw who apparently try to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.  Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as  those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity. Thus, for example, as you go on to say:   Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as opposed to political) significance.  Sometimes it will, sometimes it wont.  You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, "throws out" the deuterocanonical books.  Nor do I think you should overstress the sense in which the more Reformed may do so.   I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here.  It verges on, and could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense.  The "unbelieving" Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen people of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation. I think they have some say in the matter.  The Javneh meeting should not be over-interpreted.  A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I dont have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from the background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby "made the hands unclean" when used.  The list of "sacred books" that may be drawn up from Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book, if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh.  All of this is not to "throw out" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way, is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-)) -- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment does not do it justice.';3

Anyone who proposes this is     merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.                 -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of                     Thessalonica, A.D. 392  Note that St. Augustines conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I dont know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but Im quite sure it was after 392.  The belief in Marys perpetual virginity originated long before Augustines time.  We hold that it originated with the  Apostles.  Strictly speaking, however, Marys perpetual virginity is independent of her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately  Conceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin and not been Immaculately Conceived.   No.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception, when a persons life begins. Biology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the truth of Marys sinlessness, and the means by which God could have achieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate Conception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine, but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.  The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was given by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).   No.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not based on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation, which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.  Second, the "case for the doctrine" was irreformably sealed in 1854  with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull "Ineffabilis Deus" by Pope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be believed by the faithful.  The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never claimed that, nor shall she.

'This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine. The first fully international issue has been published and echoes  are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si).   Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993  Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you  will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse.    A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology  (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question.    On the second page of each Number an editors profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional  achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the  understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.    The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.    Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.    E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US, Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job.  At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and  philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed, and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail and by other means.  Sincerely yours,';1
'I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.  When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln  where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.  Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours  along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).  The question is:    How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCols to get   the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?

'Sorry, Fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, I must disagree.  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since those did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today, it is precisely the Khomeinis of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world Muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the Quran could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how Islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence.

'Certainly. Reference follows.   Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.  The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected.  Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.  On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point. For protanopia the point is at u=0.61,v=0.51, very close to the far red corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u=-4.75, v=1.31  Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.  So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?  This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.  *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia:  1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4) This is the new chromaticity.   The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5) 28-40.  You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.   Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago.  The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a help here.)  A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates uv using u = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D) find the intersection as in step 3 E) convert back from uv to XYZ, using the Y value from step A F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable.

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ******  Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu> Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC Date: Thursday April 15, 1993  ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nations health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.  Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled "Emerging Infectious Diseases" to be featured in the CDCs Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community. The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDCs draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments.  "This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it," said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDCs National Center for Infectious Diseases.  There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic, the first in this century, she said.  Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem. "We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past" Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.  "Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States," the CDC said.  It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.  "The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas," the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance.  =====*=====  SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1 HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues  The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage: legal liability.  A federal judges decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property.  The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical expenses and lost wages.  Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L. Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable.  Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, arent unheard-of. A summer vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant.  But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country -- its most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.  The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease.  Lawyers say workers-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in workers-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and lost earnings.  The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of negligence. Unlike the workers compensation process, the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease.  Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn & Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help to establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease."  Lawyers caution that despite Judge Wards decision, winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten. The workers, who werent outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites.  A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Wards finding that it didnt do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites.  Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness. Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease. And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.  Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson & Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical- supply companys headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected.  Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide.  =====*=====  TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease. AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH, Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30  Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended.

'I get the feeling that we are debating at cross-purposes--that we do not see the same fundamental assumptions, and this perhaps makes my answers orthogonal to your questions.  I will try again.  Perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively observable and provable things.  In that case, I cannot show you that there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need--these  things do not exist in the realm of the objective, but in the realm of the subjective.  (By a.a., I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous, and not alt.atheism ;) I would not say that AA "handles" spiritual needs.  Rather I would say that AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their needs--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the recovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a "higher power" (12-steps term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse they had been accustomed to.  (Sorry, there is no objective proof here either--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover by fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the difference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of *people* here.)  Spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to physical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc.  These are things like the need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life.  If  one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call  these "emotional needs". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs  is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual  means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do  many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be satisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who accept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I believe in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others are wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:  1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie we all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are  deluded--they just havent recognized it yet.  2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain chemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not have such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and  spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.  I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual needs cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence of God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I  could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that I appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.  I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion is that such things are not objectively demonstrable.  As I have said before,  I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the  fence by subjective evidence.  (And no, I was not raised a Christian, so it  is not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with.)';3
'Im a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied to about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to hear from the other school.  Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything,  but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, dont expect a refund on your $50 application fee.  But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it an acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How did your interviews go?  As for how long you have to wait, Ive called a few schools who never contacted me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I havent heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are still interviewing. I really dont think you should worry.  Dont become fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.  What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very mediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still, I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this:  VERY IMPORTANT -------------- GPA:	3.5 or better MCAT:   top 15% in all subject  MEDIUM IMPORTANCE ----------------- Writing/Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities  LESS IMPORTANT -------------- College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know   Anyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each person as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting  four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, you were able to impress them with your character.';2

'On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.    To quote Ungers Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:    1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and    anachronisms.    2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices    which are at variance with sacred Scripture.    3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of    subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.    4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine    Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and    poetic and religious feeling.  First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesnt, on some issues, in some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.  Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition.  I dont recall the exact dating of all of the books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the canonical books (i.e. Daniel).  Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in nature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons.  These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have shown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely objective standards for determining canonicity.';3
'The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the  "secure" voice phones will use the same crypto chip, as a de-facto government standard.  Problem is, the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on "illegal activities."  Many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release.  The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code.  They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip), they have to get the keys from both companies.

'Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislops scholarship was accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere Institute for Oriental studies.  As Ive stated over and over,  Ive checked out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were highly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.    Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his conclusions are "spurious" is without merit.  He gave references to all his conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to Hislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown even to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of seven hills?  Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You dont even have to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre.  Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two tails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the church of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so, why did the RCC chose regardless?  Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the scriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information from all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of scholorship in that.  Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no evidence supporting it.';3

Results of GUSTO Heart Attack Study to be Released Friday  To: Assignment Desk, Medical Writer  Contact: Jim Augustine of Medical Science Communication,           703-644-6824, or Steve Hull or Tracy Furey,           800-477-9626 or April 29-30, 202-393-2000 or           202-662-7592 (J.W. Marriott)     News Advisory:     Results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken, the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries trial (GUSTO), will be presented Friday, April 30, at the Clinical Research Meeting.    A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.    GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore blood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  The thrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to break up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from recurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in a large-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected to have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.    The press conference will be held at two locations: live at the National Press Club, Main Lounge, 13th Floor, 529 14th St., N.W., Washington D.C., and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe, 145 W. 44th Street, 4th Floor, New York City, between Broadway and 6th Avenue.    GUSTO results will be presented by Eric Topol M.D., GUSTO Study Chairman, professor and chairman of the Department of Cardiology at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Robert Califf, M.D., clinical director, GUSTO Coordinating Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center; and Allan Ross, M.D., coordinator of the GUSTO Angiographic Substudy and professor and director of the Division of Cardiology at The George Washington University Medical Center.     ------    Editorial Notes/Attention television: The press conference may be viewed in its entirety via satellite starting at 12:30 p.m. (EDT) C-band Telestar 302, Transponder 2V (dual audio 6.2, 6.8) or KUSBS6, Transponder 8.  Following the press conference, there will be a news package and b-roll feed.  Camera-ready illustrations also will be available at the press conference.    Telephone hook up to the press conference is planned. Availability is limited; please call MCS for more information.    For reporters who will be at the Sheraton Washington attending the Clinical Research Meeting on Friday morning, minibus transportation will be provided to the press conference.  The bus will depart at 12 p.m.; it also will be available for return to the Sheraton after the press conference.

'It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland (also a Presbyterian church)  managed to "agree to disagree" over womens ordination for 25 years.  The reasoning was that congregations are free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions choose elders.  If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they were not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not be forced to.  (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th Annivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very issue, they didnt get back together for almost 80 years).  A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  In theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be disciplined.  In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is unlikely to happen.  My personal view is that the new legislation was a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation worked very well.    We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years assembly.  At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of same-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so).  Our Panel on Doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year - the matter will be considered and debated then.  Hope this is interesting';3
'One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical  literature to keep up with changes in medical practice.  All the clamor  over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical  trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against  cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective,  treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals  are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to  use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due  to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden  Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize  the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use  and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to  restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is  yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care  patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just  because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that  all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be  found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known  for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a  women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and  not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida  colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common  than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.  The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by  a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is  warrented.  Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There  has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is  kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been  done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the  intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones  from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to  breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of  Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,  increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is  restricting calcium intake.  The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to  be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock, why doesnt it make sense for humans  David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider  yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as  Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast  infections should decline.';2
'Since this is alt.atheism, I hope you dont mind if we strongly disagree...  : The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to.  : But think about it for a minute.  Would you rather have someone love : you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to : love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward : Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.  Indeed, "knock and it shall be opened to you". Dan, why didnt this work? I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I  had sillily attributed to divine forces or devils attempts to  destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy to achieve the same mental states at will.   My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.  : Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.  God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years? If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief - what it was in my case - Id rather quit. If god does not help me to keep the faith, I cant go on.   Besides, I am concerned with gods morality and mental health. Does she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations, guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didnt she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture for those who cant believe?  I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me, shell know what to do.   : Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see : that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with "logic". : Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is : the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never : know more than you do now.   Your argument is of the type "youll know once you try". Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that  they had lived in a virtual reality.  What else but reason I can use? I dont have the spiritual means  Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible. I dont even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so does my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me if she wants.  : To learn you must accept that which you dont know.  What does this mean? To learn you must accept that you dont know  something, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I dont know, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to merely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my daily problems, would you accept this, since you cant know whether it is true or not?

'In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks,  I came across something that was completely new to me,  and I thought Id offer it for comment.  To keep this as brief as possible, let me state my  observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever  wants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think  Ive observed is that the phrase "the Ten Commandments",  as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but  rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex.  20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase "the Ten  Commandments" should more accurately be translated "the  Ten Discourses", of which the passage we call the "Ten  Commandments" is really only the first.  Im not completely convinced that the above is true, but  for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I  was sure.  Arguments supporting the above idea:  1)  There arent really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.   In order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of  them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not  support such a division because they are all about not  worshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to  have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship  the idols mentioned in verse 4.  You cant violate  verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that  the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with  only Nine "Commandments".  I could go on at length about  this, but for now Ill just stop with this summary.  2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning of the traditional "Ten Commandments") and Ex 31:18  (where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the  Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break  these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33;  25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38;  31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these  passages begins with some variation of the phrase, "And  the LORD spoke to Moses, saying..."  The exception is  Ex. 21:1, which begins "Now these are the ordinances  which you are to set before them..."  3)  The word translated "commandments" in the phrase  "the Ten Commandments" isnt really the word for  "commandment", its the word for a speech, or an  utterance.  Its a word often used for longer discourses  rather than individual statements; for instance, when  combined with the word yom (day), this word is  translated "Chronicles" in such phrases as "now the rest  of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the  Chronicles of x?..."  The word for "commandment" is  freely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps  it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten Xs,  he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and  chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer  than just a single command.  4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the  stone tablets "with the law and the commandments" (Ex  24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He  has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the  Ten Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not  immediately clear why God would wait several days and  nine more discourses before giving these tablets to  Moses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses  written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that  God would not give Moses the tablets until He had  finished delivering all Ten Discourses.  5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both  tablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If  these Ten "Commandments" were only the first 17 verses  of Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE  letters!  Not that He couldnt have, of course, but it  does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to  two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal- sized letters.  6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out  the "commandments written on stone" as being the  "ministry of death", "that which is fading away," and  "the ministry of condemnation."  With the possible  exception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is  difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in  Ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, "fading away"-type  commandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone  tablets should happen to have included all of the  commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.  Arguments against this idea:  The main argument against this idea, aside from the fact  that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that  in Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in  Ex. 20:1-17, "These words the LORD spoke...and He added  no more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and  gave them to me."  This appears to identify the words  just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone  tablets.  That was my first impression, anyway.  However, after  some thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how  you understand the phrase "These words."  If Moses meant  "These words *which I have just related to you* were  spoken by God" etc., then that would mean that only the  traditional "Ten Commandments" were on the stone  tablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical  comment--"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were  spoken by God" etc.--then thats quite different.  I did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of  being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the  people asking Moses to represent them before God,  whereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of  Moses between the first and second discourses, several  days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This  reinforces the idea that Moses remarks in Dt 5:22ff  were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a  strictly chronological account of when God wrote what,  and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the  tablets.  Summary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more  likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only  the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses  of God.  I dont know if anybody has ever espoused this  idea before; its brand-new to me.  So, while I lean  towards accepting it, I would be very interested in  hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to  offer.';3

Is there another newsgroup that                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A >  might have specifics on herbal remedies? A >  A >  Robert Allison   I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,  so Im not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.    Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should  generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid   complex instead. If you dont (and there are some exceptions to that)  youll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other  major component of the bioflavonoid complex.  I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it  showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-  fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in   hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids   to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.  Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so  there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole  bioflavonoid complex instead.   I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that   they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose   bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...  One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100s) in one day  for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.     They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, thats why they can  be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are  made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.   About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency,   with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.  For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.    In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they  are big, and they dont taste that great), a product made from pine   bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite  small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times  higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark  extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.  The name for the pine bark product is Pycnogenol.       Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:      Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable    Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing     Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable      SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing      Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!     -- Ron Roth --  =====================================================================  --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --   *   "Eating Radium has strange results,"  Tom said brightly.';2
'Aaron> Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the Aaron> putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done Aaron> by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised Aaron> with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him Aaron> from the dead."  Aaron> In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) Aaron> through a personal faith in the power of God.  Our parents Aaron> faith cannot do this.  Do infants have faith?  Lets look at Aaron> what the Bible has to say about it.  Yes, let do.  Try:   "And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me* to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck."  Mark 9:42  "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."  The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again, regenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant--through the power of the word.  The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision. Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of Gods covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be performed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this, and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.  Aaron> Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good Aaron> news.  For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message? Aaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the Aaron> message is heard through the word of Christ."  Aaron> So then we receive Gods gift of faith to us as we hear the Aaron> message of the gospel.    And the gospel is surely preached at any infants (or adults) baptism.  Indeed, in a very real sense, the sacraments are the Gospel made tangible.  Aaron> Faith is a possible response to hearing Aaron> Gods word preached.  Kids are not yet spiritually, Aaron> intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to Aaron> Gods word.    How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith? Do you know this on the basis of Gods Word, or from your own reason?  Faith is also described as a gift from God, Ephesians 2:8,9.  He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults, through the power of the gospel, Romans 1:6.  Aaron> If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesnt Aaron> hold us guilty for anyone elses sins.  So we can have no Aaron> original guilt from Adam.  Here you show that you just dont understand original sin-- you are arguing against a straw man. Maybe youve been talking to Catholics too much.  I dont know.  But original sin does not consist of Gods imputation of Adams guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of Adams sinful nature.  It is actual sin.  See for example, the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and, for extra credit, John Knoxs `The Scots confession, Article III.  Aaron> Now then that we have a little more background as to why Aaron> original sin is not Biblical, lets look at some of the Aaron> scriptures used to support it.  Aaron> Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through Aaron> one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to Aaron> all men, because all sinned--"   Ask yourself this question.  "Do infants ever die?"  Then ask yourself, "If infant baptism is not valid, then where was the Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all  of the baptisms were performed on infants?  Were Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Zwingli, Hus, Knox, Andrae, and Chemnitz Christians?   Aaron> Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time Aaron> my mother conceived me."  Aaron> This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble Aaron> ourselves before God in repentance for sinning.  David himself Aaron> was a man after Gods own heart and wrote the Psalm after Aaron> committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband. Aaron> All that David is saying here is that he cant remember a time Aaron> when he wasnt sinful.  He is humbling himself before God by Aaron> confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at Aaron> birth is a hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isnt Aaron> limited to a literal interpetation, but also uses figures of Aaron> speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).  For another example of Aaron> hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.  Who are you to say what is literal and what is not?  Is a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm 51 by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God?  You might also compare Genesis 8:21, "The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart, `Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood...."  Aaron> We see Aaron> that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The Aaron> implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he Aaron> knew to choose right over wrong.  You are a long way from proving this (rather monstrous) assertion. All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature.  A conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation of reason, not on a direct revelation in Scripture.';3

'Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals. It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:     1) ones ego outgrows ones talent/knowledge    2) ones financial situation takes precedence    3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)    4) the hackers attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"    5) ones vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"  or the biggest killer (IMO)     6) ones dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of societys       version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without       the motivation the effort seems useless.  Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember when there were several completely different computer systems, our children are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being taught the "user" mentality.  As the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we are not being replaced by the next generation.

'I wrote that I thought that 2 Peter 1:20 meant, "no prophecy of Scripture (or, as one reader suggests, no written prophecy) is merely the private opinion of the writer."  Tony Zamora replies (Sat 8 May 1993) that this in turn implies that it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader either. I am not sure that I understand this.      In one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation. If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians lost the Pelopennesian War, I cannot simply interpret this away because I wanted the Athenians to win. Facts are facts and do not go away because I want them to be otherwise.      In another sense, every statement is subject to private interpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent. Even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing, I still have to decide, using my own best judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. This is not arrogance -- it is just an inescapable fact.';3
'Ive got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery, and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique.  In the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massage" in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines! The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.';2

'Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error.  So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that.  So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood etc. Now you are saying:   If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a *lot* easier.  ----------------   Eh? Sorry, I dont understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this paragraph defeats me.   Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.  But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:    ---------------    No I dont think so actually.   You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising), manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?   Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!   I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.   ??? What are you saying ???   Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem!!    Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.   Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an approach clumsy, however.   Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You dont seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one through.    As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.   Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who, having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette.  Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?   Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.   Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)  Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for. It makes no false claims.   If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So  far, you have not done so.   Argh!!

Telephone: 0511/211216                                  Books -- Fiction  THOMAS M. DISCH  "The Santa Claus Compromise" Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and  events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...  WALTER M. MILLER, JR  "A Canticle for Leibowitz" One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives copying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper with ink and leaving white lines and letters.  EDGAR PANGBORN  "Davy" Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example, forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing... atoms".   PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  "Galactic Pot-Healer" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  "A Maze of Death" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  "VALIS" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  "The Divine Invasion" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  "The Handmaids Tale" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it "right" again.  The book is the diary of a womans life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Womens right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwoods writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  "The Bible" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that youll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.                               Books -- Non-fiction  PETER DE ROSA  "Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988 Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc. (German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums", Droemer-Knaur, 1989)  MICHAEL MARTIN  "Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press,  Philadelphia, USA. A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in the existence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in the non-existence of god(s)").  Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne. 541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)  "The Case Against Christianity", Temple University Press A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately) demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent. 273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5  JAMES TURNER  "Without God, Without Creed", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,  MD, USA Subtitled "The Origins of Unbelief in America".  Examines the way in which unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments.  "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism, Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea, the belief that God exists."  316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4  GEORGE SELDES (Editor)  "The great thoughts", Ballantine Books, New York, USA A "dictionary of quotations" of a different kind, concentrating on statements and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the persons philosophy and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiffs "What Great Men Think of Religion" and Noyes "Views of Religion". 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  "The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of Theism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackies "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised edition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  "The Miracle of Theism", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for God" such as Lelies axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martins works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A. HAUGHT  "Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness",  Prometheus Books Looks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and not only by Christians. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-64079. 1990.  NORM R. ALLEN, JR.  "African American Humanism: an Anthology" See the listing for African Americans for Humanism above.  GORDON STEIN  "An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism", Prometheus Books An anthology covering a wide range of subjects, including The Devil, Evil and Morality and The History of Freethought.  Comprehensive bibliography.  EDMUND D. COHEN  "The Mind of The Bible-Believer", Prometheus Books A study of why people become Christian fundamentalists, and what effect it has on them.  GEORGE H. SMITH  "Atheism: The Case Against God", Prometheus Books Describes the positions of atheism, theism and agnosticism.  Reviews many  of the arguments used in favour of the existence of God.

'Yes.       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       No, look again. While you never *said* it, the implication is pretty clear. Im sorry, but I can only respond to your words, not your true meaning. Usenet is a slippery medium.   [deleted wrt the burden of proof] Look, Im not supporting *any* dogmatic position. Id be a fool to say that in the large group of people that are atheists, no people exist who wish to proselytize in the same fashion as religion. How many hard atheists do you  see posting here, anyway? Maybe Imm just not looking hard enough...   I never meant to do so, although I understand where you might get that idea. I was merely using the bible example as an allegory to illustrate my point.   Evidence for what? Who? I think I may have lost this thread...   [why theists are arrogant deleted]  Guilty as charged. What I *meant* to say was, the theists who *are* arrogant are this way because they say ...  Other than that, I thought my meaning was clear enough. Any position that claims itself as superior to another with no supporting evidence is arrogant. Thanks for your apology, btw.   Explained above.';0

'[to Benedikt Roseneau ]  #In article <1qv6at$fb4@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> #  #>#The information of that is invariant under your child being a son or #>#a daughter and singing about Santa Claus. Wasnt your argument that #>#"there has to be more"? #>More than what? #More than we assume.  Which is what, exactly?  #>(a) Most of the people I debate disagree with my premises.  Hardly debate #>    otherwise. #  #Your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged #more than once. When I did it, you said, "good question", and did not #address it.  Ive addressed "it" (your caricature is not my "favourite point", needless to say) at length in a previous outing, and am currently discussing it with  Eric Rescorla.    #>(b) Theres little point in responding the same points everywhere; I do #>    my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply. #  #You still repeat that point.  I do? Curious, since I believe that was the first time Ive ever made it. Not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability to understand; you ask me the same question, Ill give you the same answer, especially when in this case, I know the answer to be true.  I do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply, but if everyone is making the same points, and Im pushed for time, then I try to respond what I  believe are the strongest formulations of those points.  If that doesnt include your post, tough; this is USENET, and life is tough all over.  #>(c) Since theres a great deal of responses this isnt always feasible;  I #>    do my best to honestly answer questions put to me. #  #You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others. You appear #with the same issue every n months, and start the dicussion at the beginning #again.  Ive only debated this issue twice in a.a, and occasionally in t.a.  The first was in response to Simon Clippingdales positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative.  It doesnt.   Now, Simon has dropped out of the debate for some time; I take that to mean that he is either busy, or bored with the topic.  I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty.  Do you?   #>(d) I cant always understand what you say #  #Neither cant I understand you all the time. Usually, one asks what the other #side means.  Usually, one does.  Usually youre clear, but sometimes you arent  and I ask you what you mean; other times you seem to get extremely uptight  and I feel that Im debating against line noise.  Sometimes I get tired, and  sometimes I have other things Id rather do.  Again, this is USENET, and life is tough all over.  Youre going to have to deal with it.  #>(e) Youre starting to get personally insulting; I may not even put your name #>    in the hat in future. # #Thats supposed to be a threat?  No, thats a simple statement, and an assertion that I am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults.  For example, those who accuse me  of lying about my personal beliefs, while also complaining that I dont answer their questions.    #>#Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there. #>#If only everything would be so easy. #> #>What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there. #>Because to all intents and purposes, it *is* there. #> #We had that argument. For one, your claim that everyone senses it #is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often. #And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it #is there unless evidence against it has been found.  I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  Its a good point, and Im thinking about it. #  #Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know, #therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process, #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological #claim, you have to prove it.  Nonsense.  My "trick" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so  does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore  that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.  Now get this:  "really is better" is an idealisation, a fictional model, in the same sense that "real material existence" is a fictional model. It may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  "trick", to wit:  I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person I ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B, or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B, then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing more can be said.    I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that  a supermajoritys carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorists - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion.  #>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not #>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by #>#others. #> #>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively #>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this #>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence #>against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense). #> #It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to #judgements is absolute. And as long as you dont provide evidence for #that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to #believe your hypothesis.  Ive done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to  answer jons objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning.  #Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective, #you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes #above look quite misleading.  Not really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently of humans?  Youll be hard pressed to find any that isnt logically equivalent when applied to values.  #>An analogous set of premises would be: #> #>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest #>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance #>            of the estate, and down the Malahide road. #> #>Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my #>            which is much closer. #> #>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my #>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim, #>using premises which are logically no different. #> #  #No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the #shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here. #And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a #shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it #is the shortest way indeed. In other words,  your analogy works only when #one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not, it is #a fallacy.  And if this were an argument for objectivism, youd be right.  It isnt, though, its a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument *against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.  Your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values arent real, and to use this to "prove" that values arent real.  In other words, you beg the question against me.';0

'#|> # #|> #Noting that a particular society, in this case the mainland UK, #|> #has few religously motivated murders, and few murders of *any* #|> #kind, says very little about whether inter-religion murders elsewhere #|> #are religiously motivated. #|>  #|> No, but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent #|> in all religion (or for that matter, in catholicism and protestantism) #|> that motivates one to kill. # #"Motivates" or "allows?"    The Christian Bible says that one may kill #under certain circumstances.   In fact, it instructs one to kill under #certain circumstances.       Id say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them to kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism allows atoricities, then thats an indictment of that theism.  But it rather depends on what the certain circumstances are.  When you talk about Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood. Its when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls apart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly harmless. # #|> For my part, I conclude that something #|> else is required.  I also happen to believe that that something #|> else will work no less well without religion - any easy Them/Us will #|> do. # #And what does religion supply, if not an easy Them/Us?  Not necessarily.  "Love thy neighbour" does not supply a them/us - it demolishes it.  And my definition of religion is broader than my definition of theism, as I have explained. # #|> #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because #|> #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by  #|> #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what  #|> #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as  #|> #being religiously motivated. #|>  #|> No.  What about that guy who cut off someones head because he believed  #|> he was the devil incarnate?  That was religously motivated. # #What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic  #labourers?     That *wasnt* religiously motivated?  Not in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants dont do this (nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), its just too broad too say "religion did this".  Im saying that the causes are far more complex than that - take away the religious element, and youd still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say stop the  killing, one might listen to that, especially when you claim not to read minds. # # #|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions, #|> and the many religous wars. # #Whats so special about these exceptions?    Isnt this all just a #grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders #to be religiously motivated?    Whats the general principle behind #all this?  The general principle is that its fairly clear (to me, at least) that religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  Its not nearly so obvious whats going on when one looks at NI, apart from violence of course. # #|> #Its not an abstract "argument".

You read minds, and I dont.  Youve speculated on my motives often enough, and you dont take my statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim  not to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry.   I also note that  you fail to answer my question.  It just looks to me very much like you have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what  most Protestants say - which is @stop the killing".  The people you refer to are properly described as Unionists, not Protestants. # #As for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion- #based?  It is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.  None of these things are synonymous with religion, though there is certainly some overlap.';0

'That is the standard advice in dermatology texts. The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Dont bother unless it doesnt work otherwise.   Exactly, but it adds to the "ritual" aspect, which is important for us suggestible patients.  (Posters, dont bother to repeat the  rationale for the soak.)   Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is  famous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin cream is, the more effective.     Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (dont buy the more expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As Ive commented before, petrolatum is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close, even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Dont panic, but also dont believe its Gods gift to the human skin.';2

'This thread si starting to get really silly. Such nonsense do not belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on this issue.  We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief!  There is no wonder that your "miracle" does not work. You designet it yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like the one you describe, I see no reason why your "miracle" should really happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans!  After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you?  Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way better than others.   Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I dont know. But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are faked.  In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He said that "I do nothing, except what my father tells me." Perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example!  In Him, Bjorn';3
'Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:    26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often   since the foundation of the world; but now once at   the consummation He has been manifested to put away    sin by the sacrifice of Himself.    27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die   once, and after this comes judgement;    28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear   the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to   bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.   The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christs sacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen  mankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his  "Christianity and Reincarnation".  The thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and  sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual  experience of the human being after death.  The "once"  is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity  of Christs deed.  One thing for certain it does is to  refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than  once.  But the comparison to the human experience - die  once, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just  "judgement".  The word for judgement is "krisis".  Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this point, I would just emphasize again that the  passages  that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of Hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context, namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death.  What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc- tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.  We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them. But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist and "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences; the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of the body, and the Last Judgement.  Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their sins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to  works, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of the sacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and  Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such  as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.  There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible  does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others)  could not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the greater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes,  not the end of mans sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.';3
'> A Christian friend of mine once reasoned that if we were never  > created, we could not exists. Therefore we were created, and  > therefore there exists a Creator.  I hesitate to comment on the validity of this, because I do not know what your friend meant by it. If he meant that whatever exists must have been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God exists, and so God must have been created.  Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a time when we did not exist, and therefore something other than ourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible, but an atheist might reply, "So my parents engendered me. So what?" Here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of causes is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn Rand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having argued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between said entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically unlike them, few physicists would disagree.';3

'Stephen A. Creps writes to All:  [...]   SAC> Also, we know that  SAC> the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  Where exactly does it say that?   SAC> _Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the  SAC> contrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the  SAC> Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what  SAC> it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  I think we do see an exception in the case of Cornelius and his household, mentioned in Acts. Of course, they were baptised, but only after "God showed that He accepted them by giving them the Holy Spirit". This means they were already acceptable to God before their baptism, and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven.  In case that seems far-fetched - an ancestor of mine was a missionary who worked among the Hereros in Namibia. Some of the tribesmen were jealous of Christianity, and they poisoned the first convert before he could be baptised. Surely he still went to heaven?

'What is fornication? (sex outside of marriage, abuse of sex)    Is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage? Isnt it an unatural use of what God has given us?  Why is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to practice sin?      For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long    beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who    turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only     Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.                                        Jude 4 (NASB)  What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage?     For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and    shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh.                                        Gen 2:24 (NASB)     And He answer and said, "Have you not read, that He who created them    from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, FOR THIS     CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE;    AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH?  Consequently they are no longer    two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no    man separate."                                         Matt 19:4-6 (NASB)     But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let    each woman have her own husband.  Let the husband fulfill his duty    to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.                                        1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB)   I disagree... Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at  as sin.  That is why we have a need for a savior.  I can understand  someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law, but I would hope that they would repent when confronted with it.    Also I noticed that the preceeding verses say.       Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her    menstrual impurity.  And you shall not have intercourse with your    neighbors wife, to be defiled with her.                                       Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB)  These verses are just as relevant as:     You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an    abomination.                                     Leviticus 18:22 (NASB)  Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things?     Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these    the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.    For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its     punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.    But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and     shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor    the alien who sojourns among you                                      Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB)  He is the Lord...  Listen to what he has to say...   Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals.  We do love you, but we dont  agree that what you practice is not sin.  You have not truly repented of your sin.  We hate the sin that is within your lives.  I hate sin that is in my life.  All Christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives.  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance.  Yes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"  Matt 3:17.  If you dont agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?  This means that you remain in bondage to it.  Repent from it and God will set you free.

'Marhaba Nabil,  If we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the human Jesus, then we must admit two wills.  A mind is not a mind without a will.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined.  T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this:        _____________		      (Mind of Logos)      (	 _______   )      (	(	)  )	Here, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the      (	( Human	)  )	Son.  God the Son has complete access to the human      (  ( Mind	)  )	mind but the human mind only has access to the mind      (	(	)  )	of God the Son when the Son allows access.  This       (	(_______)  )	explains why Jesus said even he did not know the       (_____________)	time of the kingdom.	  The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never the case.  He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.    The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons.

'[does he believe in predestination]  really?  you may be right, but id like proof.  as far as i know (and i am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination.  my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing gifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions!  ill answer how you deal with this in a minute.   right.  that doesnt really seem like predestination to me, but ill continue with what youre saying....   this is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for ALL of us.  preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses.  but then, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i? others?   so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where its needed and not where it isnt?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved, and nothing in between.  hmmmm.   although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to be some sort of "sign" that someone is elect, like lots of children or success at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who dont are doomed to hell.  in a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth.  thats almost like the converse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die.  youre saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange....    so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if its  sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?

'That is an assumption on your part.  Where is your proof that one always will degenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin.  I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America.

It is also true that many  individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it.  Dr. Kings message was this.  Love the individual, the loving of the individual would transform him into a friend.  However, this did not take away his hatred for segregation.  His hatred for injustice.      I would ask, "Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish Leaders of his day?"  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple?  We must have at least a distase for sin.  We must in order to fight it in  ourselves.  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its right name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name.  It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth.  -- "Competition is the law of the jungle.

A lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible- distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The ACLUs Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the courts action protected the "religious neutrality of our public schools." He also said that schools must serve students of "all faiths and none." Schools were not to be a "bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts," according to Lynn.  Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools. They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to continue their work at a distance, but find the schools position somewhat disheartening.  I understand rationally and logically the courts position. And, I can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other hand, when does "neutrality" become "nihilism?" When does plurality turn into no position at all?  I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.  The other is that while we are seeking "religious neutrality" in our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced "religious neutrality" for the past seventy years--are making the  Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St. Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents. I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin. Now, thats ironic!  I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid.  However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our schools only signals once again our cultures movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions.

'hypodermic it.  there is me.  Looking in The Evolution of Anaesthesia by M.H. Armstrong Davison (pub Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore 1965) I found the following chronology:  "1853.  Charles-Gabriel Pravaz (1791-1853), inventor of the galvanocautery, describes a glass syringe with tapered nozzle. This syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting ferric chloride into aneurysms, and thus to heal them by coagulation.  1853.  Alexander Wood (1817-84)  of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic needle and adapts Pravazs syringe for use with it."

'I dont like the term "quack" being applied to a licensed physician David. Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion). Ill give you some examples.  	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no  	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.  	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid  	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.  	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has  	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by  	   the NCI.  These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should  not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of  which result in malpractice suits).  I dont think that using anti-fungal  agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be  having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of  commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to  relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures, others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a  chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the  healers oath, "I will do no harm".  But you know David that very few  treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a  very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each  physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some  are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive  approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long  as the motive is improving the patients health and not an attempt to rake  in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in  the medicare fraud cases), I dont see the need to label these healers as  quacks or even unethical.  What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.   These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the  frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are  really doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine.  But  many lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make a  few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting  competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative  care area is really a buyers beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find  someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of  money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo- medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the  liscened physicians).  I hope that this clears things up David.';2
'Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in what?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn does not exist?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa Claus does not exist?  If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it certainly isnt as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god) DO exist.  (I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of "faith".)  Besides... not believing in a god means one doesnt have to deal with all of the extra baggage that comes with it!  This leaves a person feeling wonderfully free, especially after beaten over the head with it for years! I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer for many people and for that reason I think its important.  However, trying to force a psychological fantasy (I dont mean that in a bad way, but thats what it really is) on someone else who isnt interested is extremely rude.  What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better person, allowing me to live without guilt, etc...) and then tried to get you to believe in Santa too just cuz he did so much for me?

'Thats fascinating.  I take it that youre expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Heres some more:     Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our "founding    fathers," but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany    Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the    Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,    and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion    Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were    revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the    American psyche.    ...       By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the    Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited    forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors    on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged    his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at    Albany Congress: "It would be a strange thing...if six nations    of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union    and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted    for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should    be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies."       According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs    and congressional delegates in order to "hammer out a plan that he    acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy."  Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation_ addresses this issue.';0

'Another one rescued from the bit bucket...  Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and elsewhere on the net.  Generally, the discussion comes down to the contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against Islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly as a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it offensive, without fear of persecution or death.    I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an interesting position, because I think this is a fine book, only incidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover Im damned if I can find anything malevolently offensive in it.  Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book and had called it such things as "filth and lies", "I would rank Rushdies book with Hitlers Mein Kempf or worse", and so on. Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to believe that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.

I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as Im concerned, it is just as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.  I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesnt fit your current frame of reference.

': Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:  : (Technically, the messengers arent even human so : it *cant* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...]  : The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of : the Sodomites "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels.  Again, : application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of : gay Christians is largeely specious. : *** : Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because : of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).  : what are other opinons on this? I havent heard much about this verse   : at all.  Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those who were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension, God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:  	"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament, 	refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24)  	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self- 	exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders 	of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to 	their followers." [p. 199]   There is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring to actual sexual lust for "alien flesh".  Nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin of homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and not merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, bit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.  For the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondents suggestion that the reason the passage doesnt deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There  are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.';3

'No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible to know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs  potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and  antihistamines!)   Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of the drugs a patient is receiving.

'I dont know either.  Truth be known, so little is known of angels to even guess.  All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in the nativ tongue of the person theyre talking to, so perhaps they dont have ANY language of their own.   Well, we are told to test the spirits.  While you could do this scripturally, to see if someones claims are backed by the bible, I see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy Lazarus really was dead and now hes alive.   Its a common fallacy you commit.  The non-falsifiability trick.  How can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen?  Answer:  I cant.  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove  anything.    When I say it has never been proven, Im talking about the ones making the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving.  The burden of proof rest with the claimant.  Unfortunately,  (pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end pontification).  But truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just so poorly translated into English) that much remains unknown about just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hard proof one way or another).

'Im working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.

'Youve asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy.  The overall purpose of chemotherapy (dont worry about the spelling.  Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time.  Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.  The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs. The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized  aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.  There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis. Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis. At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing.  If what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to  experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications  can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.  Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person  themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.  I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society. They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition, if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery". It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast  because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.

Such methods : are used all the time to lie with statistics.  Answering the last sentence, claimed that they had a success rate of 80% without initially explaining, until pressed, that this meant that 80% of the aircraft came back having dropped their bombs somewhere, regardless of whether they had hit the intended target, or indeed anything al all.';0
'Pauls statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of ones destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.  And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist, who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to  have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But  it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether  he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in  the first case and very weak in the third.  I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed  in this newsgroup in particular.  I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christs deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes  important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our  understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the  significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I  have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible  to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.';3
'The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free    will in any way.  Since God knows everything, He therefore knows    everything that is going to happen to us.  We have free will, and    are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows    everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God    is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination    against free will.  We believe in both.  That last sentence of Steves is an important one to remember.  There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be completely comprehended by a human being.  Were this not the case, it would be good evidence that the religion was man-made.  In the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that would at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of Gods will over all things, and mans free will in deciding his own fate. Catholics believe in both!  But that doesnt mean that anyone has come up with a pat reconciliation...';3
'May I ask why they are afraid to do so?  ---    Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a   term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, "God must exist, because   he wouldnt be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really   doesnt!"  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological   proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among   others?';0

'But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we all have defective appetites due to original sin.  Not just homosexuals, but everybody.  Thus we are not entitled to indulge in whatever behavior our bodies want us to.  I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual _behavior_ (which is wrong) and homosexual _orientation_ (which is not a sin, merely a misfortune).  [Please: NO EMAIL REPLIES.

'I have seen Copper Bracelet by the name of Sabona created by Dr. John Sorenson.  I am looking for literature on the effectiveness of Copper Bracelet in dealing with Arthritis.   I know in one case a 70-year old person developed bruise at the base of her left thumb after wearing the copper bracelet on her left wrist for several months.  She was told the bruise is "normal" and would disappear.   Is the bruise reason to be concerned? Should the person discontinued wearing the copper bracelet? Could anyone kindly point me to literature on copper bracelet? What are the other information on copper bracelet?  Your response would be very much appreciated.  Thank you.  Lau Hon-Wah';2

'agents of  The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points.  Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling.  Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have tried a rapid transit system for hip fractures, aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early.  Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.  Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing more it is hard to comment.';2
