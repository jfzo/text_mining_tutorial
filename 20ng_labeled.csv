'Hi,  	I have a problem, I hope some of the gurus can help me solve.  	Background of the problem: 	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a  	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain 	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming 	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments. 	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.  	My problem is this : 	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller 	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell 	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole , 	else it is trivially rejected.   	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo.  	somewhere for doing this.  	Any help would be appreciated.  	Thanks,  	Ani.';1
'(Well, Ill email also, but this may apply to other people, so Ill post also.)    Your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (its a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a womens resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.   This happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are (maybe its the hustle or stress or...) Ive had this happen to me a lot, often because they didnt realize my car was broken, etc.  Then they will come back and wonder why I didnt want to go (this would tend to make me stop being angry at being ignored and make me laugh).  Once, we went off without our boss, who was paying for the lunch :-)   Well, if you cant turn to the computer for support, what would we do?  (signs of the computer age :-)  In closing, please dont let the hateful actions of a single person harm you.  They are doing it because they are still the playground bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause.  And you should not accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless - much wiser people hold you in great esteem.';3

'Let me carry that a step further.  Most doctors would not claim to be  infallible.  Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to  be necessary after all.  However, the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.  As fallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong.  However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable, and stand by their convictions.';3
'[insert deletion of Pauls and Aarons discourse on anger, ref Galatians 5:19-20]  Oh, but they definitely can be.  Please look at Colossians 3:5-10 and Ephesians 4:25-27.

[insert deletion of remainder of paragraph]   Please, re-think and re-read for yourself, Joe.  Again, the issue is self-control especially over feelings and actions, for our actions stem from our feelings in many instances.  As for God giving in to his anger, that comes very soon.';3
':) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I didnt have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when its dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till its softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. Ive heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. Thats why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there wont be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that its normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes its money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).';2

'I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.  I did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary). I explained to her that I was following up at the doctors request, and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective.  The doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you want, youd better make it quick.  Im very busy and dont have time to chit- chat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I  then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time is a good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said "well, never mind" and he said hell talk to various colleagues about other medications and hell call me some other time.  This doctor called me that evening and said because I didnt express myself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told me that he just doesnt have time to "rap with patients" and thought that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to "rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he  felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me this apology: "I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I dont have a lot of time to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.  I am still upset and have not yet called.  My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care? (2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive? If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but now I am afraid to call him.';2
'A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  Youre missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head their own "churches").  "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." - Matt. 7:21.   Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis- credit it as well as the Bible has?   Well, its really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require Gods help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their lifes writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me). The spritual life is a difficult journey (if youve never read "A Pilgrims Progress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).   Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You wrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father", not "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, Im not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of mind, something to contemplate.';3
'Hi:  I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor. It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law.

'Define perfect then.       Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but dont make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.   (Deletion)   That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible, nothing less.';0

'The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias).  Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign.

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.

'I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.   About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

'Exactly.   C. S. Lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately. First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- "a great coward."   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.   - Phil -';3

The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I cant tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best position to make that determination.  Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia?

Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.  Finally:  There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the Fathers.

'The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesnt itch.

It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town, although I dont know if that has anything to do with anything.

'I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works very well.  Thats not my point.  Im >philosophically< opposed to it because of its complexity.  This complexity has led to some programs poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files, other programs inability to load TIFF images (though theyll save them, of course), and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.  As the saying goes, "Its not me Im worried about- its all the abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and unnecessary) complexity of the format.  In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized emphasis mine):  "The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB), and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many image-generating applications out there now."   If a program (or worse all applications) cant read >every< TIFF image, that means there are some it wont- some that I might have to deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I dont and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not that anyone does, of course! :-)';1

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a womans chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct 89 - Oct 92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct 89 - Oct 92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

"Krillean" pictures are portraits of tiny shrimp. :)  [...]   I think its safe to say that anything thats not at 0 degrees Kelvin will have its own "energy signature" -- the interesting questions are what kind of energy, and what it signifies.  Id check places like Edmund Scientific (are they still in business?) -- or I wonder if you can find ex-Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere in the relcom.* hierarchy.  Some expansion on Kirlian photography:  From the credulous side: [Stanway, Andrew, _Alternative Medicine: A Guide To Natural Therapies_, ISBN 0-14-008561-0, New York: Viking Penguin, 1986, p211, p188.  A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to illuminate   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The objects life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around peoples   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isnt actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can see   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   cant possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.    [...]    Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally charged by a healer   has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...   From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; a consumers guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986, vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the authors favorite examples of hokum.]    The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of   study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The   variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown.';2
'My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus Ive never really believed in God and heaven, although I dont actually believe that they dont exist either - Im sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately Ive been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but Im not used to believing things without proof - just as I cant believe that there definitely isnt a God, so I cant definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions dont?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isnt there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if theyre not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and Loving my neighbour for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is Gods attitude to people like me, who dont quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly good people. Surely not believing doesnt make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. Im sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

'If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will  generally find yourself in one of two camps:      (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation or (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works  Either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will  inevitably result in good works.   I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when  read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Pauls use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinners profession of faith being  "justified" or "proven" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a "dead" or  "useless" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

People die for lies all the time.    Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the answer is no, they wouldnt be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things.   Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God doesnt exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely inspired and one cant use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by unbiased observers.   Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan, Jim Jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics.   So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad.   Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such riddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional prophecy.

Verses:    1 Corinthians 6:9-10    Colossians 3:5-10  As for knowing when, thats a bit tricky.  People normally have consciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a conscience can be hardened by sins deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so that the person has no idea (or doesnt care about it) that they are sinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we dont know that theyre sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is:  "Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time?"  I know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling question.  Joe Fisher';3
'#I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the #ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,  I dont like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try: 	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM 	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print 	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript 	lpr			# print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4" wide, use: 	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it 	is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a 	width less than 4", and will thus be printed smaller than 4" wide. 	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4", and 	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified 	paper width.  	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size, 	but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps. Marcel.';1

'I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models. Scientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.  As an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science.  It wasnt long after Sagans admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one- dimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation between the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness from reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagans model showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model  in sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to our boys model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer. He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry, the biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would probably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.  To quote from H.S. Yoder,  	The postulated models have become accepted as the reality 	instead of the lattice of assumptions they are. 	Authoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical 	analysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism 	of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because 	many key parameters have not been included.  This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results may one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought Id clear that up before things really got out of hand.    --  boundary';3
'(Deletion)   No it in the way it is usually used. In my view, you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives.   For me it is a conclusion, and I have no more faith in it than I have in the premises and the argument used.       No, thats a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually. When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.   Interestingly, there are those who say that "existence exists" is one of the indubitable statements possible.   Further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete, making it a fallacy.

'My turn to jump in! :)   I think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics. Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some peoples life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?

'No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common forms of meningitis.  Its the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.

There isnt much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.

'According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking "in Xs name" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus culture authorized to conduct business "in Johns name" had full authority over Johns financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for Johns benefit and consonant with Johns wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with "in Johns name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of "faith".)  With this cultural background, praying "in Jesus name" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous "fiduciary" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of "praying in Jesus name" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about Gods delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying "in Jesus name" is not only present but prominent in the Lords Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words "In Jesus Name" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of Gods Kingdom.  For that reason, Im not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) dont seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (thats B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I dont see anything in Christs words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

'If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the     Pope cannot "be wrong!"  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter     of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the    Pope is the legal head of the church.     In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it "infallibilism".  Its the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didnt quite get around to defining it.  Now theres no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Popes doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.';3

': Exodus 21:22-25:  :        22 And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with :           child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further :           injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may :           demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. :        23 But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint :           as a penalty life for life, :        24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, :        25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.  : The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if : men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty : is only a fine.  If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the : *lex talionis* doctrine of "an eye for an eye" applies.  This is the : Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on : these verses. :    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is : of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the : word "miscarriage" to mean "premature birth"--i.e., the child is born : alive--and "further injury" to mean injury to either the woman or : the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not : (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does : not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.  What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is  little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination.';0

The network is expected to cost between  $75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton  administrations health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside  experts.

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  "We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time  and money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the  new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand  the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The Florida researchers, led by  Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said,  "This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal  precautions are strictly observed."

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research."    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  Its only fair to give the  Office time to gel, but  its up to the public to insist that its much, much  more [than  public relations]."  ======================================================================    "Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143,  No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)        Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune systems natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune systems fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lussos research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lussos   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lussos  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIVs attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkleys editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in the  Balance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS."   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAIDs division of AIDS.  "We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children."   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAIDs division of AIDS.   "We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "Well also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects."   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIVs surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned  on," or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience."       Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available."       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patients HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSAs Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA Administrator  Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve."       "This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSAs associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  "Providers who treat people with  HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment  methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS."

'I would recommend "Essential Truthes of the Christian Faith" by RC Sproul. It is copywrited 1992 from Tyndale House Publishers.

As they are burnt, it would seem logical that some may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I dont know if these toxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh conditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross the intestinal mucosa?

'Dear Tim:  You say that you were a "catholic," but if you do not believe in the Christian God (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,    you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  "Public heretics, even those who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the body of the Church" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).  All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a mans soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostles teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: "Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation."    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is one of the best sources for learning what can be known about God.    Stick with the best. --  boundary, the catechist';3

'Why dont you just look it up in the Merk? Or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?    Among others, see Olneys  "Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.  Im sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.   Whose talking about "food science"? What is this comment supposed to mean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*, *Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)   Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome" in a few articles. Why dont *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.   Theyre unable to metabolise it.   Who said anything about received wisdom? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? Its unethical to "sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. Thats why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If youre talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.    Olneys work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches? I dont know.';2
'GB> From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) GB> >(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic). GB> I hope you meant "inarguably".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.';2

'Well, it wasnt that way for Enoch and Elijah, both of whom were translated directly into heaven.

She was after all, Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.   And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in St. Andrew of Crete, among others.  And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a big hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as far as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).';3

'To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So theres a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call THIS science?"   (My opinion, for what its worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)    Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I dont believe it is  ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.     My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.  Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later  mathematicians did prove them, of course.)    I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and whats not  as it is a  matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of  incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to  objectively convince others of the validity of ones results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step  of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward  that goal then one is not doing science.)  When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation.     Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately  specific question to try and answer.    The "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science  currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.   I certainly wasnt thinking of some idealized science or the mere use  of "reason and observation."  One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.    Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there  is any existing research related to this question.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.';2

'There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.  The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2  This equation can be rewritten into the following form:       2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2  Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1  For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.  In Numerical Recipes in C can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.  The best fitting sphere will have  - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2) - radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).

'(MODERATOR: THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER, MORE CLUMSILY WORDED SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)  I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of how the word Easter *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to Christians other than the feast day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.   The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of "pagan goddess" by celebrating Easter.  It is nonsense to say "this word (or this practice) really means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it."  Words and practices dont mean things, people do.

Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the minority.   Where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  If someone wrongs me, I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone kills another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn. Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?  Or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should never be violated?  This would sound like some sort of religious view.    Once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.  And, you still have not answered my question.

'If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first. Id be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didnt even come back for followup because they didnt want to admit they wouldnt take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people dont understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasnt reported a death from taking. Patients dont realize that and dont usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  Im sure Herman is going to "go ballistic", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didnt.  Why they didnt isnt always the physicians fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They wont be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."';2

'Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But thats really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Heres some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPXs "schism"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someones compliance or refusal and then say whether they are "obedient" or "disobedient".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they arent being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them "disobedient".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And theres the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where theyre wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, theyre wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... lets move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But its a superset, so it doesnt work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests dont comply with the Holy Fathers desires doesnt make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and thats what youll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Heres what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article "Schism")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And thats all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Fathers motu proprio "Ecclesia Dei", you can find out.  Its the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  Its not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  Its from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... theres no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvres problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Popes points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine "Si Si No No".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Popes jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The "Si Si No No" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so cant tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Popes thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. Theres no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, heres the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio "Ecclesia Dei", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvres concerns in detail.  What is John Paul IIs stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I dont know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey "justified disobedience" or even "obeying God rather than man". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  Its one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  Its something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.';3

'Its not a bad question: I dont have any refs that list this algorithm either.

'Again I find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither the time nor the proper materials with me (you would think I would learn my lesson by now--but Im trying to finish writing my Thesis and dont have tons of time.

The basis for our (the catholic churchs) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.';3

'for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning "Passover." In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "Spring Festival."  However, Bedes is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in "Die Sprach," ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as "albae." Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for "dawn." This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.   Yours,  James Kiefer';3

So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, Id be glad if it were gone to.  Ive never supported it.

I dont think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  Thats silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I dont advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.

'Lets say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danons excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove the errors in the other data points.

Briefly, you start with two 15 minute sessions daily, and progress in 8-12 weeks to performing 10-15 thirty second sessions daily.

'Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.  The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.  I am under the impression that MSG "enhances" flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.  Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is what I suspect as being the cause.  I wouldnt be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.  Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the tobacco companies still deny).  - DM  (If I sound grumpy, its because I had beef with broccoli for lunch today, and now it hurts to swallow)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dan Myers (Madman)		| If the creator had intended us to walk  myers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu	| upright, he wouldnt have given us knuckles';2

'[deleted]  I cant speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to  the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isnt.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all ones mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.

'Be sure to say "chronic" dizziness, not just dizziness.  Most patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better. The vertiginous spells of Menieres will also eventually go away, however, the patient is left with a deaf ear.    This may have helped you, but Im not sure it is good general advice.  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim.  When good answers to these problems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers.  Until then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive things in life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to make a career out of it.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."';2
'Well, its been a while since this was discussed so i take the liberty of reprinting (without permission, so sue me) Eric Haines reprint of the very interesting discussion of this topic...                  /Jonas                           O /         \ O ------------------------- X snip snip X ------------------------------                          O \         / O  "Give a man a fish, and hell eat one day. Give a man a fishing rod, and hell laze around fishing and never do anything."  With that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this years papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??), 	by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff  	From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu 	Newsgroups: comp.graphics 	Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem 	Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By "output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.   	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the 	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of 	Choice (or equivalently, Zorns Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of 	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.  	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the 	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in 	other words, will it halt?  	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a 	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is 	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn 	out to be undecidable.   I wont even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, hes hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but thats ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who dont know what all this is about, read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didnt you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didnt you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didnt the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is Yes, but what has it to  do with this package??? , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you cant understand a word, dont worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you dont have to worry about that if you dont want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select OOP-Guild.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

'Hi Adda,  Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of "Bibles" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.   From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Paul, James, and one other not identified.   As long as you make it.   Regards,';0
'Vera Shanti Noyes writes;   Of course I believe in Predestination.  Its a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace cant be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell. 							  ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He cant bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, Davids sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of Gods judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but im going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a "just war."  "Blessed" after all, "are the peacemakers" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.';3
'The story I related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our Church as worthy of belief.  It happened in La Salle, France.  The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be aware of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey Gods commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story again:     I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid shes "going to lose her     Sons arm".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.                                                                         Mary tells the children:                             *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           * *    uses her Sons name in bad words.  That is          *     why her Sons arm is so heavy in pain.                   Then she asked them if they pray.  The children          said "hardly".  She asked them to pray every             morning and night.  When the children went back          from work they had to tell somebody about this.          When the news was spred and after thorough           *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        * *    were converted and faith and obedience to God       * *    were restored in their community.                   *   Once again, the Lamb succeeds.';3

'I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us "subject to sin and death" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus "fully human" (Nicea) would not be "subject to sin", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish between "human" and "fallen human" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.   First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestoriuss version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son "uncreate" -- surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestoriuss opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept "Nestorianism" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that "Nestorianism" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesuss human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by "subject to sin".  The original complaint was from someone who didnt see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didnt sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that theres reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least "rash and dogmatic" (as the editor of "The Christological Controversy" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says "To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood."  Its all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have "to some degree" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that theres a certain indirectness in the Logos participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we dont have an incarnation at all.

Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your "Traditional Proofs" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think youd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, Ill assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and Ill accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest youll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isnt self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) cant do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself human, but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we cant question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope youll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something wed both agree was clearly true.  Now, youll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didnt, wed still follow Aristotle. Id generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us.

'Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luthers rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend "to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies."  It adds that "not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command."Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Popes authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We dont even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy."  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishops critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled "Penalties for Specific Offenses" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of "Penalties for Specific Offenses" which is entitled "Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: "A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See."  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishops lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:';3

'Im not sure who the "original respondent" was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not synonymous. 	So in sum and to beat a dead horse: 	(1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_. 	(2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more "color sensitive" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.

'Mark Ashleys account of private revelation does not, as some might think, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church believes that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  In that posting I made sure I used the word "public".  Public revelation contains Gods truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

'Hi... Im not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There "....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies."     					Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [Im not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  Its pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  Thats because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I dont think theres much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also dont think theres enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that dont affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  Im surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  Ive been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, its not any edition thats widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  Its been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, Im afraid.)';3

'Terms are being used in a loaded way here.  "Logical proof" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real life. If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.';3
'[There may be some misunderstanding over terms here...]  I agree.  Quite likely, actually.                                                        [...I believe "Jesus    only" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  Im not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who wont    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age." {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like "one essense and three persons".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term "three-fold" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cents.  Its unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: were commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  "Jesus only" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  Im not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase "in the name of".)  Those who use the three-fold formula dont seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that "in the name of" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course theres a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesnt require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use "in the name of Jesus" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as Ive said before, Im not the one to explain what their doctrine is.';3

'And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word "throne" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no recourse, excuse or defense.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at "moderation."  I think we have seen the extreme of the "hell fire & brimstone" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didnt believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldnt do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they dont believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesnt exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didnt exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  Id use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it.  When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isnt called, oi vey!.  Whats with that ref that he didnt make that call.  Its unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.   I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all, repentance isnt only a turning towards, but also a turning away from! No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.    I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality.  1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness. 2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.    If responsible, then he is also accountable. 3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God. 4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to    the "whosoever will."';3

'-*----  I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes. Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you dont like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a "theoretical structure that makes sense" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Lets face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can.';2

'(Deletion)   No cookies, Charlie. The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that dont match their evidence.

'Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory behind them.  E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isnt what  is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.  Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience. Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that  people dont want to be associated with that sort of thing.   --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."';2
'Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a fast render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the users    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the users    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you dont need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for 	faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesnt support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it cant, but because    I dont have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      Thats all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers Ive provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and Im not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - Ive certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

'And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded "impact" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Dont bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.';3

'I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence  and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for  each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require  different levels of evidence.  	As one pointed out, ones history is important. While in FUSSR, one  may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans.  One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.  	The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the  level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the  consequences of the proposition are.    	If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain  why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between  two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their  distance apart.   	Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the  consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of  affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law,  they are irrelevent when theorizing about the "Truth" of the law.  	Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including  the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of  affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find "The Truth"?    	By the way, what is "Truth"? Please define before inserting it in  the conversation. Please explain what "Truth" or "TRUTH" is. I do think that  anything is ever known for certain.

'In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people, where a person just "came to know" some piece of information, where a person walks off into the desert for "40 days", etc. With all of Gods power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible "ends" with the book of Revelations. But does Gods reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that Gods messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response Ive gotten from the past from this group, its very hard to get the point across. Ill only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. Ive cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. Theyre still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show Gods existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is "approved" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, thats a bit too late, isnt it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions ("coming to know"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christs wounds. And they dont heal. And doctors dont know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, Im sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). Its free. Find out why theyre happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not "members only" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RCs believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although were told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why "not everything is in the Bible". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...

'Oh, Bobby. Youre priceless. Did I ever tell you that?  My policy with Bobbys posts, should anyone give a damn, is to flick through the thread at high speed, searching for posts of Bobbys which have generated a whole pile of followups, then go in and extract the hilarious quote inevitably present for .sig purposes. Works for me.  For the guy who said hes just arrived, and asked whether Bobbys for real, you betcha. Welcome to alt.atheism, and rest assured that it gets worse. I have a few pearls of wisdom from Bobby which I reproduce below. Is anyone (Keith?) keeping a big file of such stuff?

Doesnt that       contradict atheism, where everything is explained through logic and       reason? This is THE contradiction in atheism that proves it false."            --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #2                "Plus, to the believer, it would be contradictory                     to the Quran for Allah not to exist."            --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #3  and now     "One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that say "Mom",     because of the love of their mom. It makes for more virile men. Compare     that with how homos are raised.  Do a study and you will get my point."          -- Bobby Mozumder being Islamically Rigorous on alt.atheism  Mmmmm.

'Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup.  I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as Im sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didnt come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as the Bible is Gods word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am beyond saving so he wont try?  Thanks for any advice.';3

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, its just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesnt like it - thats it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any "absolute" sense. That you dont like what God told people to do says nothing about God or Gods commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way youve been conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didnt make these rules, its inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.';0
'I will answer this as I find time.   Notice what I said about this book.  I called it "Easy reading."  The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simons.  I dont know how many walking encyclopedias I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isnt in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  Ive talked with Schaeffer one on one.  Ive been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and profs from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the profs themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isnt grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:   "More without limits is less;  less with limits is more."    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Lets put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianitys contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, "Father I do not understand you but I trust you."  Now dont read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasnt saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway." It means that "I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway"  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent "whying" of a 3 year old.  It isnt just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.';3

Youve got a point, though.  There are some who dont want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because theyve not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly dont have an answer to this.  [insert deletion]   My parents had nothing to do with it.  God had and has everything to do with it.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  Ive been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  Im female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions Ive been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  Im really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:  	- someones idea of an innocent joke, that went awry 	- someones sick idea of flirting 	- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I dont know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I cant lock up every book I have in the office.  I cant trust that someone wont shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when Im not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I cant stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that its ridiculous.  I feel like Im some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like Im a sub-human piece of garbage thats not worthy of a simple phone call saying "Were leaving for Marys lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting..."  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isnt tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when Im terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I dont turn into an automaton because of this. Thats my bad habit: "ignore it and it will go away", "youre not worth anyones time so dont go talking to anyone about this", "youre right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way", "you are just an object", "you prostitute your mind to this company so why cant others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?", "what makes you think women arent just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts dont come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesnt come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and its also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesnt drop me from his loving hand, but its awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think Im falling and forget that Gods still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isnt entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.

Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didnt come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, hed come out.  He finished the first one, but didnt do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didnt come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.  I think its really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well.';3

'As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfer immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.  In fact, a calf _must_ have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than) 24 hours the intestines are "open" to the IG passage.  My question is, does this apply to human infants to any degree?';2
'There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the "meningococcus", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I dont have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis is a huge topic, and sci.med cant do it justice.';2
'Jesus was born a Jew.  We have biblical accounts of both his mothers ancestry and his fathers, both tracing back to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic. 	As an interesting aside, Jesus being semitic makes him neither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on. 	Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think its chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because "Ethiopia" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.

'Dear Netters:  A new religious newsgroup "soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya" was pro- posed  on  Oct  16,  1992. The discussion about this new proposed newsgroup went on in various related groups.  The  proposal,  was supposed to enter a vote during the last week of November 92. Due to a false Call For Votes, by some opponent, the voting had to be canceled.  I  quote  here  a  statement  from  the  moderator  of new.announce.newgroups:   "The current Call For Votes (CFV) for an Ahmadiyya newsgroup  is being canceled. A new call for votes will be issued within  a few weeks, possibly with a new impartial vote  taker.  Discus-  sion on the proposal is still open until the new vote is called..."                                 -- by Lawrence, Nov 20, 1992.   A lot of confusion arose among the netter as  to  whom  to  vote. Therefore  it was decided to give a cool down period, so that all confusions are over. It has been over 4 months  of  that  instant and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup. A fresh RFD is hereby being issued. Please! take part in  the  discussion under the same  title heading  and in  "news.groups"  or at least cross-post it to "news.groups".   ****************************************************************                  REQUEST  FOR  DISCUSSION  ****************************************************************    NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP:  ==========================       soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya   CHARTER:  =======       A religious newsgroup, which would mainly  discuss  the  be- liefs,  teachings,  philosophy  and ideologies of all major reli- gions of the world as  they  exist  to  foster  better  religious knowledge  and  understanding among followers of all religions as they share common basis. This newsgroup will be devoted to  build a  peaceful  mutual  understanding  of  the  Ahmadiyya  branch of Islam, its peacefull beliefs, ideology and philosophy and how  it is  different  from  other  branches  of Islam in fostering world peace and developing better understanding among religious people. It may also be used to post important religious events within the World Wide Ahmadiyya Islamic Community in general.   PURPOSE OF THE GROUP:  ====================       The following are some of the main purposes this group will      achieve:       i)   To discuss the common beliefs of all major religions as           they relate to Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.       ii)  To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings  of this           puissant spiritual force on earth.       iii) To examine Islamic teachings and beliefs in general  in           light  of the Quran  and established Islamic traditions           of 15 centuries from Ahmadiyya perspective.       iv)  To discuss the similarities  between Ahmadi Muslims and           people of other Religions  of the world and discuss how           religious tolerance  and respect to others  faiths can           be brought about to  eliminate inter-religion rivalries           and hatred among people of religions.        v)   To discuss the origin and teachings of all religions in           general and Islamic and Ahmadiyya Muslims in particular           to foster better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and           other religious people.       vi)  To discuss current world problems and solution to these           problems as offered by religion.       vii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya           Muslim Community and other Religions.       viii)To add diversity in the religious newsgroups present           on Usenet.       ix)  To discuss why  religious persecution is on the rise  in           the world  and find  solutions to remedy the ever deter-           iorating  situation  in the  world in general and in the            Islamic world in particular.       x)   To discuss the contributions of founders of  all  reli-           gions and their  people for humanity, society and world            peace in general and by the International Ahmadiyya Mus           -lim Community in particular.   TYPE:  ====  The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo- gue.   The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement or dissent to beliefs, but will mainly be used  to  prevent  derogatory/squalid use  of  dialect  and irrelevant issues. The moderators have been decided through personal e-mail and through a  general  consensus among  the proponants by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:  Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu)   Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca)    A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/ISLAM: =========================================           The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.          The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.          The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sects internal resources.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.   NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================';3
'Sorry, youre right.  I did not clearly state it.    The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s), and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say theres a lack of consistency here.  Now I know youll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational people have problems with that "logic"?  But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.   ;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?    It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because its still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he had wrought.   First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?  One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something beyond this life.  You can pretend that they dont want this, but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.  And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God. Can love as a truth be proven, logically?    John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course, I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically, you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant, Jesus, for instance.   I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective.   No apology necessary.  :) -- Bake Timmons, III';0

'I have found that this isnt a very effective argument.  Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I dont think its possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?';3

'No, the argument says John has known Q, ie a codified version of the logia, and not the original, assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses, of course, like that John might have known the original, yet rather referred to Q in his text, or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place.   The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion, but it fits well into the dating usually given for the gospels.       Not necessarily, Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive, for instance.   As far as I know, the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts.       Yep, but it will take another day or so to get the source. I hope your German is good enough. :-)       I still do not see how copies from 200 allow to change the dating of John.       Yes, but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence. The authencity of many letters is still discussed. It looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well.       Well, rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from the big meeting. Not necessarily wrong, but certainly bad.       Yes, but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem.';0
'[reply to aldridge@netcom.com (Jacquelin Aldridge)]     The acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific.  The application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than science.     Certainly we dont have all the answers.  The question is, what is the most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  The scientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  The *only* reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny, insisting that "tradition" or anecdotal evidence are sufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crooks ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence.  His unwillingness to do good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions.';2

'Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  Im certainly not questioning Steves claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I agree that foods dont bring on the recurrence of Crohns.  But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.  Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically, the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem. Therefore, anything that doesnt digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided.  With what Ive been told is typical Crohns, of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:  Completely out - never again - items: 	o corn (kernel husk doesnt digest ... most of us know this :-) 	o popcorn (same) 	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins 	o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)  Discouraged greatly: 	o raw vegetables (too fibrous) 	o wheat and raw grain breads 	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since its apparently mostly water) 	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...) 	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arbys without it!) 	o long grain and wild rice (husky) 	o beans (youll generate enough gas alone without them!) 	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing  I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If its bad, dont do it again! Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think its cooks more thoroughly - youre mileage may vary.  As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Dont just take my word.  But this is the info Ive been given, and it may be a starting point for discussion.  Good luck!  -Spenser';2

'Oh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.  Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of Gods own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwigs fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus (21) and Philosophical Investigation (53).  Many of Witts comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witts thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witts own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrightss comment that Witts "sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language."  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witts own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why Johns Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of "as a man thinketh, so he is."  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldnt shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancys Sweeties conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

'I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesnt work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I dont have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.  Ed  Thanks to all who answered so far.';1

'Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing bad acts, people temporarily become atheists?';0
'Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:   I never thought of these two ideas being "against" each other. People might quibble about what "intrinsically" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesnt David ask in the 8th Psalm "what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but Davids power easily defeated Goliaths.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says hes done that his whole life, probably anticipating an "attaboy" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if its so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with Gods help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how "hard" other religions are is a good one, just  as your "Parting Question" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name "submission". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that "God" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but youre right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that Gods personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindus conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldnt have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.  Are there any former (or present) "Eastern Religion" members here  who could comment?';3

'As to what that headpiece is....  (by chort@crl.nmsu.edu)  SOURCE: AP NEWSWIRE  The Vatican, Home Of Genetic Misfits?  Michael  A. Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed  some unusual  data after working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   "The Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur.", reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair, first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late 1950s.  "The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didnt want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his skull.", notes Gillow in his report. "There are whole  laboratories in the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400s is now scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats." Gillow is quick to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.  "When it becomes time to replace the pope", says Gillow, "The old pope and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  butt heads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  The victor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir boys."   P.';0

I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I dont have a Bible at work, and cant provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I dont claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you cant agree how to interpret the Scripture?    Its very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the  Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that  you in fact interpret?';3

'[why do babies get diseases, etc.]   Heres the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what weve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) started off in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. Im really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, Im sure youll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesnt do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants overgrazed, (forgive the poor terminology, Im an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, whos making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Heres another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by perfect in the phrase, created... perfect and without flaw? To my mind, a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time. A perfect system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmers glue? That is, the original genetic instructions were perfect, but were written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isnt any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that Im aware of.) But, I couldnt help making a few nitpicks here and there. :->  Sincerely,';0
'Gee!  Maybe Ive misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say cant be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, Im not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesnt use methods deemed "scientific"  can possibly know whats true and whats not.     Okay, so lets see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If this hasnt been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it cant be of any interest to us."    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "Thereve got to be controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the worlds most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesnt take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesnt need to be repeated and the subject doesnt need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since theyre not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying "We dont have any way of  knowing that its effective."    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove your  theory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim."   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt  been described in a scientific journal.  (Its described in a number of  books and Ive posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as Im capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but its apparently not acceptable because its a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.';2

'Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didnt have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it cant store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  Its not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.  Thanks.';1

'Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius	grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his fathers     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lords suffering to	show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint	Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius   				  -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  "Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?" "I will not, father," was the  in-evitable  reply.	"Then     leave from my sight and dont return until you change your mind!"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to	pray:     "Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time	he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. "The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him." He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from	carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul	to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.

'Must there be a "why" to this?  I ask because of what you also      assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no "why"      to His existence.

But the possibility is there,      given scientists are working hard at "decoding" out "genetic      code" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.

'In <Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313@athos.rutgers.edu>   [ . . . ]  Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is its being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isnt a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to "get em in and get em out".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.

'First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lords existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.  	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride Gods decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.  	People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on Gods wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.  	This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?  	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.';3

'You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book "Orientalism" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read "Orientalism" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isnt too long).   I havent read Lewiss article, so I cant comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read "Orientalism" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title "Islam and Women", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Quran and contains numerous Quranic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Quran and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Quran and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Quran prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says "I am a Muslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Quran or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the Quran" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.';0
'Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett,  (Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lenss ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Batess  idea, right?)';2

'Is it just me, or has this part gotten beyond useful?  Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdies life.  If thats correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners dont accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that Im picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didnt say "in agreement") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law ("legally" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards,  Dew';0

'You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  Im not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I dont view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  Its basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  Im reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayers clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:  	 Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms 	 could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that 	 the Popes position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX 	 dont jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that "Im NOT wrong, I CANT be wrong, and    theres NO WAY Ill change my mind, YOU must change yours", that    Ive either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesnt go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isnt the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, Im not Roman Catholic. :-)  Thats heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that its pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, thats what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, Im not trying to be contentions, Im trying to understand.    Since Im Orthodox, Ive got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Popes commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.';3

'=   = : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ] =   = : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  = : (at least to this laymans mind) there must be a causal event.  No = : reasonable alternative exists. =  = I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  = causes precede their effects.   And I must concede here.  Cause *before* effect, implies time, time is part of spacetime.  Hense, the argument would be valid.  I could return and say  that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being *unique* to *this* spacetime, but I wont 8^), because the point is moot.  Doesnt address why (which Petri Pikho addresses below).    I also concede that I was doubly remiss, as I asserted "No reasonable alternative exists", an entirely subjective statement on my part (and one that could  be invalidated, given time and further discovery by the scientist).  I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that "this is how it happened", but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question.  Am I mistaken with this understanding?  = But if you claim that there must be = an answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  = "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.  All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith.  The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.   With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.  It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as best as a non-repeatable event can be "proven").  But I ask, what holds   someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by  faith?  [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask "Why does the universe exist" ]  = I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely =  = 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists? =  = and =  = 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing? =  = It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, = is it a meaningful question, after all? = = I would say it isnt. Consider the following:  Apparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.  = The question "why anything exists" can be countered by = demanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness, = or in non-existence".  Actually, both questions turn out to be = devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that dont exist = dont exist. Tautology at its best.  Carefully examine the original question, and then the "counter-question".  The first asks "Why", while the second is a request for definition.  It  doesnt address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define  the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for how do we identify something as "nothing" (arent they mutually exclusive terms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is nearing the limits of this simple laymans ability to comprehend, and I would appreciate an explanation).   I might add, the worldview of "Things that exist do, and things that dont...dont" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, as does the theists belief in God.  It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately (un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason.  We come to this. Either "I am, therefore I am.", or "I am for a reason." If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are satisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just beginning.    = I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Time will tell. 8^)  =  = Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is = Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this = answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is = actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and = them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Agreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well.  = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God = Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, = it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always = existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His *qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).  = The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not = accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes  that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against  scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer "why".   It appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer.    = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isnt = : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). =  = This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how", = not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why" = questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the = supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is = as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.  My apologies.  I was using why as "why did this come to be".  Why did pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  But we come to the admission that science fails to answer "Why?".  Because it cant be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the question invalid? = : I dont believe *any* = : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite = : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion. =  = This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are = somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians = in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce = they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was  *vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming "Inquisition!", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope weve gotten beyond the "shooting the messenger" stage).  M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask "What do I  as an individual Christian base my faith on?"  Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our "sacred cows" or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and continues to say) in his Word?  "Why do I ask why?" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).  Jason.';3

'I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators.

'One thing that I havent seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs).  I was diagnosed last May w/Crohns of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed laypersons perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid products to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad." Isnt this ratio the issue?  Whats the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).';2

'Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   Ive often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  Ive      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"      was behind the universes existence.  Ive      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, Ive known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and Ive even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      theyve kept this belief in some form of higher      "being."  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Quran, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      tures truth is to damn ones soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesnt stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the "right" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."      Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and      "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions hes been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of Gods existence and question it impartially?

Theres another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, youll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,   etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following   address for more info:       National Space Science Date Center      Goddard Space Flight Center      Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      Telephone: (301) 286-6695      Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov    The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.   Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log   in as NODIS (no password).    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,   no parity, one stop). At the "Enter Number:" prompt, enter MD and   carriage return. When the system responds "Call Complete," enter a few   more carriage returns to get the "Username:" and log in as NODIS (no   password).    NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of   whats there is available at present.  Earth Sciences Data -------------------    Theres a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including   imagery. This listing is called "Earth Sciences Resources on Internet",   and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]   in the directory COGS under the name "internet.resources.earth.sci"    Some sites include:   aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images   ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from         Magellan and Viking missions etc.         pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole         archive (the index is about 200K by itself). Theres also an         e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter         to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server).

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epsons. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that dont have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, theres a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: 	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd., 	00196 Rome Italy, 	Piazzale Flaminio, 19 	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you cant be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  Theres a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in   "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  "Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan 87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newells teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep 87 in Jim Blinns column "Jim Blinns Corner" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so youre advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Heres a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the models distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isnt normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanfords InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  Im not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraws binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgifs sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. ice requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.Its a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and its available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and its an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  Its a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages Ive heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  Im not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  Ive   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  Thats a   freebie if you want it"    "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if its not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldnt handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, its mostly astronomical   image processing which Ive been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because its public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERLs Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI   database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and   God only knows what all else -- theres a LOT.  I dont have and dont   use these, so cant say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from   a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default   directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  Theres   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different   "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industrys "CT2T" format, would probably (I havent tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOURE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  Its worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to   contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI "database").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"   in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesnt suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  Its   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.

'[Stuff deleted]     Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by Gods grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christs commandments is a "work" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really dont have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we dont do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really dont have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

'One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that without bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup. It almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart. Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted write about.        How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If you want to be religious arent there more plausable books out there? Seriously, the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they invented.        For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didnt god say not to EVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didnt god say not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Dont you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?  Was Jesus illiterate? Why didnt he write anything? Anyone know?        I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot. The only reason xtianity escaped the middle east is because a certain roman whos wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome xtian after a bad dream.

': Hi,  : I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. : ... I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and : quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying : to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful : to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other : relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would : like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological : works intended for a lay person?  Id recommend McDowells "Evidence that Demands a Verdict" books (3 I think) and  Manfred Brauchs "Hard Sayings of Paul".  He also may have done "Hard Sayings of Jesus".  My focus would be for a new Christian to struggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence, especially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith.';3

In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new, hot of Gods tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say.   If you like Ill get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes.

'I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didnt come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who cant hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" - but I dont know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but Im not sure whether Id believe her.)';2

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall twos rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (Im also using Mode X, 320x240).  Ive run into two problems; Im sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  Im now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?

Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which dont have to change size as they move about in the room).  Ive decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.  Thanks in advance for any help.';1

'Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com     Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our  culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer  an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different  perspective on the "church choosing process". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesnt subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and "leave yourself on a few doorsteps" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldnt expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.';3
'In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps involves acknowleding a "higher power".  AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people religious, and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the God-shaped hole), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

'This is the problem. This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor unfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made mostly of carbon and water is "fair".  However, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily includes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation); not at all the same thing.  Granted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral sentiment as near as I can tell.  If *your* idea of God "condemns" heathens to ordinary death, I have no problem with that.

'What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by "omnipotent" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean "being all-powerful" and not "being able to do anything/everything".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily "omnipotent".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do "whatever it wanted". The US would simply "never want to interfere" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.  Regards,';0

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        "People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation," said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  "When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge."       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Associations medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        "Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,"  says Dr. Schwartz.  "But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well."      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        "Researchers cant Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution," says Dr. Schwartz.  "We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPAs current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      "In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and thats  rarely particulate matter," says Dr.  Schwartz.  "However, PM10 doesnt have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy."

Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer centers operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse  for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical  education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with  other users.    To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                        FTP.UCI.EDU  The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope  to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).    Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you  have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education  efforts, either as an instructor or student.    Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either  the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the  mode to binary and "send" or "put" your files.  Note that you wont be able to  see the files with the "ls" or "dir" commands.  Please compress your files as  appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something  similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.    After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for  MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you  have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.  Note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated  as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.   Please do not upload commercial software!  Doing so may jeopardize the  existence of this FTP site.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last weeks  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Armys test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   "The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project," said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  "The Limits of AZTs Impact on HIV" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drugs cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

'This kind of argument cries for a comment...     : >>...God did not create : >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns. : >  : >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is : >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldnt we?  Perhaps the biggest "imperfection" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting "theological arguments" like this.  Try Watsons Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimores Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesnt mean its perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than weve thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us "knows" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  Id replace "created" with "formed", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  Im sorry I cant give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed "degeneration"?   I can understand Scotts reaction:  : > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!   :  : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you dont forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present ones own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more "complex", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didnt make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I havent seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering Johns question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it Gods fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing "evil" is gods fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you dont know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I dont think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what youve done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are "meant" (presumably by God) "to be : punished by getting diseases".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit its not perfect (yet).  But Im working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They dont explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a "why behind"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although Im sure Id find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  Im sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to  beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy  does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.

'I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldnt help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    Ive been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  Thats okay because I  know that some of what Im teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  Its really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools dont cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaines doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaines doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  its food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isnt certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it. If its internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all Americans die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From its name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes its nice to know that I dont have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, its not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldnt have a problem with your behavior.

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you dont mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesnt support JPEG directly, youll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  Its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  Ill let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you dont have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG cant squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, dont JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision youll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesnt accomplish a lot, youll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell its been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEGs characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, Ive seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; its not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs dont even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you dont know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you dont have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- its usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you dont see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradleys free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  Its available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called xv-???.tar.Z (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pub/xv directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means its not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (youll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldnt use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because theyll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristys free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzels free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but its functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaeis Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but theres no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you dont have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so dont try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I dont know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOWs JPEG implementation isnt very good: its slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... itd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you cant get *any* of them to work, youll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, dont use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Groups free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you cant get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSIs proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internets key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But its so fast youll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it cant create new JPEG files, and it doesnt view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but its an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, youll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apples JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If youre running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTimes JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, its the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some dont.  Overall, JPEGViews user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But its faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apples free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developers tool, and its really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as its even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technologys Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines cant use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to JPEG to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you dont want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to JPEG to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  Its cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If youre willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space its stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  Theres also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  Youll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone elses files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; dont forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and dont know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you dont know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything thats free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if youd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  Whats all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people dont have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  Were stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEGs lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasnt read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isnt a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients dont have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: youre stuck with the senders quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didnt use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, youre out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware. JPEGs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, youre stuck forevermore with what was sent.  Its also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often its also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This articles long enough already, so Im not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  Theres a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs arent compatible with anybody elses.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work thats been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  Its not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; its reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apples QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Softwares programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wont read, its likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by JFIF.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     its worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with hsi1.  Youre out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     wont decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for JFIF).  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: its a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	"begin" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	"begin" line 	M:-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isnt great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  Its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If youre wondering why, its because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but thats a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you dont want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, its far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors dont convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Dont waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, dont expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XVs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpegs default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG cant compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than youd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you dont want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpegs built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.';1

'In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing "There is no way out of the loop."   Someone called `REXLEX has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because   However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEXs post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:   I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I dont claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.    But how far does that get you?  Once Gods revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, lets suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, "This is my body."  Well presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didnt say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said "This is my body."  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only "very confident" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didnt think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so dont let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, Id suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.';3

'The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but I thought Id hop on, anyway...  What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifers fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to "choose" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifers free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifers fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?';0

In case you dont know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my    knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic    object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns    or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type    of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might    extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within    the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.  There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals) published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I cant be more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.    These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the "energy signature" of organic objects.  I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school. I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by first dunking them in water.  Barbara --';2

'Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  Gods will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  Gods will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as its head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christs return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isnt it about time for his return.  Its been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded "impact" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Dont bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.';3

'Yes, its important to realize that all actions have consequences, and that "rules" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesuss time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think youve missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldnt tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  Ive said this before, but I think its a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isnt what I would want it to be, but Gods grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (shes had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to Gods intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.

For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.  Note: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a "ceremonial detail."   Dont many Christians still practice circumcision?   Its unfortunate that Jesus didnt use your name directly, or maybe Jesus did? Are you somebody or nobody?   If you dont see a problem, then perhaps there is none. As Paul closes Romans 14 (Gaus):    In short, pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up. Dont let dietary considerations undo the work of God. Everything may be clean, but its evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit. Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesnt condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isnt acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.';3

'I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net. My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated.

'A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the plane (it may require you to give it a "cut" though...)  E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch) are "developable". In more technical words, a developable surface is "locally isometric to a plane" at all points.   Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable: whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

'Well, I could use the argument that some here use about "nature" and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers you have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence, you cannot have superhuman powers.  Sound good to you?  Anyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group, since you are posting from a american college site, Im willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some coherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.   Yep.   Good.

As for the second, it is the foundation of the religion. Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period) is a believer, and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since these are all ancients anyway, one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else-- even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*, so again I dont see how evidence is possible.

'Hello everyone.  Last week I posted a similar question to alt.wedding.  Now I come in search of a deeper-level answer.  My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic.  We plan on getting married in her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there in a month or so.  I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed to do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church.  Needless to say that I have found that there is no "hard and fast" rule when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted. But Im pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem; the trick lies in the letter of dispensation.  But that is not why I am here....  What Id like to know is:    What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions?   My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood...

'Hi,  I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person?  I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated with any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria should one use in choosing a church? I dont really know the difference between the various Protestant denominations.  Thanks for reading my post.   Sincerely,  Steve Hoskins';3

'Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term "always" is rather deceptive, I admit.      Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I dont believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)    Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.      God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly  unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate  interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong.  Care to deny that?';3

'The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Lukes text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So whats that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies. Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.     In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.';0

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence "humanism"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesnt mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of "economics" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was "the free rein of the market mechanism", while for others it was "the dialectical forces of history". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.  Steve';3

'(WEBSTER:  myth:  "a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.")  How does that qualify? Indeed, its almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. Ive found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as "accepted uncritically," especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they dont meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone "knows" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If youve read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesnt make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, thats clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone "knows" your alleged gods alleged existance.   1) No, they dont have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And thats ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesnt stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesnt generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesnt exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods arent.   No, human reason hasnt always come back to the existance of "God"; it has usually come back to the existance of "god". In other words, it doesnt generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesnt pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in "God" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and its reasonableness certainly doesnt merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.

'First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16. The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but "(at best)  second-hand".  	"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching 	 Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and 	 he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, 	 why are you persecuting Me?"  And he said, "Who art Thou, Lord?"  And 	 He said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . ." 		(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)  Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were  followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.   I agree.  I dont believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you  the Spirit exists.  Please dont complain about this being circular.  I know it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural? (This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)   The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get? The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as "inspired by God",  literally means "God-breathed".  In other words, God spoke the actual words  into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is  one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and  incompleteness of "inspired by God".   Thats what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a  book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks  of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.    What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus writings, or the writings  of the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.   Jesus was fully God as well.  Thats why Id assert that he is wise.   Please rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus? 	In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims.   The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out. 	About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the writers, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the  least without the Spirits guidance:  	"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit  	searches all things, even the depths of God."

[Reproduced without permission]  	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England, 	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under 	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and, 	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if 	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group 	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and 	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after 	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage. 	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a 	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. 	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers 	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did 	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not 	necessarily go hand in hand. 	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining 	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. 	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the 	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins 	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame- 	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in 	the amount of food eaten afterward.  	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing 	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a 	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government 	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing 	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. 	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and 	after the sweeteners entering the market have failed to confirm 	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  Thats why the 	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with 	monitoring public health), the American Medical Associations 	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration 	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a 	clean bill of health. 	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of 	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed 	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take 	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of 	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt, 	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,... 	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams 	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups 	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content 	of selected foods omitted] 	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away 	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called 	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000 	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential 	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child 	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause 	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with 	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other 	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics: 	Contains Phenylalanine."';2

'Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics, the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume "Christlike" natures, most of us do not even come close.  I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that it is my way of rationalizing mans constant (or so it seems) conflict.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------';3
'This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian.  So then, you might  consider switching from Christianity to another religion if you were  offered an even more frightening description of another hell?  How many Christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy? Not many I know; they believe in a message of love and compassion for  others.  A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional  relationship with God.  Like a child who cringes in fear of a parents physical violence.    Many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell, with various threats and persuasions regarding who will go where.  Competition over who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving your neighbor as yourself.';3

'Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A&E -- some 15 years since I saw it last.    I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances). Clearly they "faked" a lot of the computer & robotic technology; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself, let alone the idea of a "space germ".    Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _Howd They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDCs top lab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be "cracked" so to speak by man or nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  And the researchers used "spacesuits" similar to that in the film.  Im curious what people think about this film -- short of "silly". Is such a facility technically feasible today?

'INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.

'When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving, communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or "Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity" or "parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government", however  they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.  "We are a atheist society" in fact means "we reject the din other than ours".   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.   I think it took more than one minute.';0

'_MY ADVOCATE_  I sinned. And straightway, posthaste, Satan flew Before the presence of the Most High God And made a railing accusation there. He said, "This soul, this thing of clay and sod, Has sinned. Tis true that he has named Thy name; But I demand his death, for Thou hast said, The soul that sinneth, it shall die. Shall not Thy sentence be fulfilled? Is justice dead? Send now this wretched sinner to his doom! What other thing can righteous ruler do?" Thus Satan did accuse me day and night; And every word he spoke, O  God, was true!  Then quickly One rose up from Gods right hand, Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes; He spoke, "Each jot and tittle of the law Must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies! But wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred To Me and that I paid his penalty! Behold My hands, My side, My feet! One day I was made sin for him and died that he Might be presented, faultless, at Thy throne!" And Satan flew away.

'Yeah, and its also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I dont argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we cant model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I dont think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just havent seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but Im not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  Ill believe it when I see it.  Ive been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still dont believe in it.  If its so great, how come we dont see it competing with JPEG?

It is neat, though. :-)  Ill reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  Thats why I dont think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.

'In a word, yes.  I dont believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we wont begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I havent heard an outcry to abolish it yet!

'Theres been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr.  Burzynskis treatment as a result of the decision of a forum members father  to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma.  This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynkis track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.

The patients oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynskis  treatment.

'Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to  bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to  soc.religion.christian.  [Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Marys _blessedness_/full of grace in the "Annunciation" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgins  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women."_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - "the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women" - while you read on....  In the book, "First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Marys Conception_ under the title "The Conception of Saint Anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christs sinless body"; she is "Gods Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms."  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now lets go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From "Pocket Catholic Cathechism" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adams sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the puzzle):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Marys birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriels greetings was: "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the tabernacle for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart.';3

'Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.  Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred years old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.';2

'[remainder of message deleted]  Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)  The reason we can say "God just exists" and cant say "The universe just  exists" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural  laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  Gods eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.';3
'Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, "Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God," and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for mans alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newtons head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  QED   --  boundary';3

'Michael Bushnell writes;   Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not. 	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasnt there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning. 	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)  	"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray." 	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and  	"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son" 	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.  	"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both." 	-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary. 	In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above. 	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone "to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea."  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.  	"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it." 	-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)  	"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father, and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you." 	-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)  	"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father, and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father, and `will receive of mine, so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation.... 	"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created." 	-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)  	"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources." 	-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)  	Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the "proceeds from the Father" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.';3
'I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally dont take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because Ive found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  Ive tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only "real solution" to my problem.  Although I dont expect to have any more children, I dont like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all Im left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesnt work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so Im through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as Ill discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (its actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime Im frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  Ive had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (Ive had 2 of them, and dont intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the "internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so Id  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I dont have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really cant avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but Im avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (Im a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I cant concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I cant really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. Ive taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I dont like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasnt very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  Ive tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didnt work, or I couldnt tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctors seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  Ive had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and Ive already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what Im saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.';2

'Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the "sexism" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book "Brainsex".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophets widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading "Islam and Women" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that "other religions are no different" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophets first wife, who died just before the "Hijra" (the Prophets journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.';0

'I love it, I love it, I love it!! Wish I could fit all that into a .sig file! (If someone is keeping a list of Bobby quotes, be sure to include this one!)    The Flat-Earthers state that "the Earth is flat" is a fact. I dont accept this, I think its an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are right because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.  Although I cant prove that a god doesnt exist, the arguments used to support a gods existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and Im not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that I absolutely cant ignore.  A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken, in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he wrote something like "Can you prove it isnt so?" I certainly cant, but Im not going to believe him, because he based his "proof" on some really questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it "circumstancial evidence" :] ).  So far, atheism hasnt made me kill anyone, and Im regarded as quite an agreeable fellow, really. :)';0
'I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw it just as poetic license, but its understandable that others might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:    #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, its a good idea to   #do a little homework, or at least think.  was unnecessary.   Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think youre reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel.  Anyway, Id rather be somewhere else, so Im outta this thread.';0

'Sorry for posting this, but my e-mail keeps bouncing.  Maybe it will help others here, anyway, and therefore I pray others will read this.  It is actually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.       Im posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail access.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more relevant than I, who have none (yet).       13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl       I dont call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.       I dont call it spanking because its more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has not been spanked yet.      They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know theyre still loved.       No, that would be too painful.  If its too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans youre not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  Its very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking.      Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made sure they didnt play together for 5 days so hed know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  Hes never done anything like that since.      We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they dont keep arguing with me over leaving, since its hard to argue with a macine. I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout wont be over until they calm down if theyre too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when theyre really young.       40       Bath, Ohio.  Its right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.       No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isnt always required - parents use that as an excuse to hit too hard.       Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husbands have never used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or Gods law.      Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that "what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me."  The Bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.) There is no room for selfish anger, which Ill admit Ive been tempted with at times.  When Ive felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the devils work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking Gods forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what I had done was enough punishment.';3

Never mind the stoning, the being   burned alive, the possible crucifixion ... lets just talk about a   scourging.  The whip that would be used would have broken pottery, metal,   bone, and anything else that they could find attached to it.  You would be   stood facing a wall, with nothing to protect you.  "When the whip hit you the first time, it would tear the flesh off you   with instant incredibly intense pain.  You would think to yourself `All   this for a lie?  The second hit would drop you to your knees, you would   scream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at again.  You would   say to yourself: `All this for a lie?  And you had 37 more coming.  "At the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie, beg for them   to stop, and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all   been a lie, if they would only stop...."  It is amazing enough that those who believed kept their faith under such   torture.... but for a lie?  There is no one fool enough to do that.... And   no one came forward.

'Actually I dont think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that "faith without works is dead"  and, "I will show you my faith by my works."  Remember James was  writing to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad."  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldnt understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Pauls statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Pauls life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the "Judizers" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think "faithfulness" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not "keep kosher" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that "pistis" has some of the force of "faithful".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume thats not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what Id call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.';3

'I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.  	I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.    	I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.  	While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So dont start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!  	I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in Gods eyes.  	But Im digressing....  			God be with you,';3

'It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didnt have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.';3
'No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you. The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Neros blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Lets not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy';3

'The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a "truth" is not always "true" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldnt we conclude that the statement, "There are no absolutes" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankinds sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.';3
': I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   Ive been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god "just in case"? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascals Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesnt care - it believes, but doesnt know what or how.   People dont usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not "born in the Spirit", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   Im afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldnt notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - Ive yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri';0

'I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the  specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce.      I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyones decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more "deep, committed relationship."  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he cant be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  Thats life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my "needs."    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple "grows apart" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.

'[ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to or onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print. Whod have guessed?';1

'...   Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldnt need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated.  My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.  (stuff deleted)   And what if the original poster, Pixie, is never "converted?" Does it make sense that she (or I, or the majority of humanity for that matter) would go to hell for eternity, as many  Christians believe?  It makes more sense to me that rather than be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no life for her, that she simply continue to decide for herself what is best.    --------------------------------------------';3
'Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful ideas about how to choose a church:  Colossians 1:15-18    A.  Jesus is the head of the body, the church    B.  You cannot say "yes" to Jesus, but "no" to the church  Ephesians 2:19-22    A.  The church is the family of God    B.  The church is based on the Word of God only           Cornerstone=Christ           Foundation= Apostles=New Testament                       Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)  1 Corinthians 12:12-13    A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church  As for the question of denominations:    A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians 4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13    B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in the church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church (and in time, their writings)    C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy 4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle  Hebrews 10:24-25    A.  Do not miss church    B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful. Involved on a relationship level in the church    C.  Must come to ALL services  Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.  Of course, more standards apply:    1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie, disciples).    Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul (natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly face to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didnt take Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the pastors statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (wouldve made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of Matthew 24).';3

'THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?                     by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didnt realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governors ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.';3
'Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?  Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. I took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The  clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the  doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not  see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed  here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several  trips to the back room, the receptionist told me: 	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back, 	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going 	  to the emergency room; 	- the doctor would not even speak to me; 	- she would not tell me the doctors name, or her own name; 	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I dont know."  I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  Im still  trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a  letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.';2
'Ann Jackson (ajackson@cs.ubc.ca) wrote on 5 May:     I would like to submit the following which helped me enormously. If it has already been posted, I apologize.  It seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to  explain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water. Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor. Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.  And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.  Thus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on ones particular need for Him.';3

'On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were "invited" to take the role of Jesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail.      As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests dont seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess its easier to "try something new" than it is to refuse to allow it.     At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet ("Who wants to get around peoples feet," according to one of our priests) the congregation was "invited" to come up and help wash one anothers hands.     The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. "Body of Christ" -- "Amen" for receiving Communion), that they could be "I am not responsible for the blood of this man."     Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer ("Blessed are You, God of all creation...") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we arent required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).      The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be "liturgically" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be "creative" who are not.     I think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of Thomas Days _Why Catholics Cant Sing_.  "They dont want to" because of all this nonsense.     By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own "authority."';3
'The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization  can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the bench.  Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it (as long as my advisor doesnt catch me - which is easy enough to do), but  stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review  committees and the peer review process in general.  In todays world thats  what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to. Flights of fantasy just dont have much chance of producing anything, at  least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with  fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MDs seem to  be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.     I have to agree with Gary Merrills response to this.  Ive read alot of the Alu and middle repetitive sequence work and its really very interesting,  good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  Its  really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting  results that were unexpected.';2
'[ Much deletion.  He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary.]   If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and be like gods?  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them?  To me the wages of sin are a spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.  I can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience. I suspect that many others could attest to this as well.   Peace Will  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------';3

'[ ACT 5:40 - 41 ]  ... ...  The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Lukes account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Lukes account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.   What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be disapointed.';3
'Hi! Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now Id like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the balls center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didnt touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).';1
'Sure. Yes, I did. You see I dont think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for leniencys sake, apparently think that people should simply be told the "did a _bad_ thing."    Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible. I suspect that its pretty unlikely that, given my requirement of repeated offenses, that misjudgments are very likely.                Really? Care to give chapter and verse? We could discuss it.      Again, not all of the Orient follows the Quran. So youll have to do better than that.   Sorry, you havent "put out" enough.           This is an argument for why _you_ dont like religions that suppress sex. A such its an irrelevant argument.  If youd like to generalize it to an objective statement then  fine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion (one of your "arguments").  The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner.';0

'I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I would like to respond to both.  As for the "goal we can never achieve", the reward comes from the trying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus. As it says in 1 John 5:3:  "This is love for God:  to obey his comands." That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this requires work on our part.  As for the quote in James, Satan doesnt care what we believe.  What matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place.    Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing Gods work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel Jesus presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  "Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction."  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:16:  "Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers." So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are correct first.  Remember Jesus warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be hypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed.';3

'Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said that people would come to Him saying "Lord, Lord," and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him.    That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent. But people should be careful not to think, "God has given me a gift of the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay."  That is dangerous (see also hebrews 6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of  the world to come.)   Jesus doesnt ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the morality that God has set forth.    If you dont believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant, then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sakes. Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the homosexuals or the one considered "ignorant?"';3

'Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?   Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark?   Are they clear or do you have doubts?   An important first step; the realization that Paul was human.   Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best, very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the message of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this market still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To be "weak in the faith" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the best that your education allows. Are you doing the best?   Let me make clear that the "Law" is none other than the Pentateuch of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say about the "Law" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the "Law" only applies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the "Law"?   Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this point? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only relevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was Magus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother with any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to say?   I dont see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a follower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that the words of Jesus only apply to Jews?   How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?   Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?   Youre implying that Jesus words are valid only for Jews. Is this really what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus words, did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what your race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of Jesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?   As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.   Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications that you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or God of all humankind of all race and sex?   This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law was an "impossible standard?" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law? Are you Christian or Pauline?   You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say? Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you  Christian or Pauline?   When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?   Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?   Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?   You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested, ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?  ....  Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  Thats why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I cant come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that it applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when youre looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  Im not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, its unfortunate the Jesus didnt answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (Im referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I dont see that theres a big problem.';3
'Thats not true.    I gave you two examples.   One was the rather pevasive anti-semitism in German Christianity well before Hitler arrived.   The other was the system of social ranks that were used in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest  of the population.  Neither of these were very terrible in themselves, but both helped to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of Jews was made easier.';0

It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.

'Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting ones mind roam freely and giving rein to ones intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first.    Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we dont understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the  key elements in developing it.    Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwins naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the  theory of evolution.    This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.     I dont think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.';2

'I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then, but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago.  The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evenings discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, "which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion."  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of "overpopulation," rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, "because it involves too much study and effort."  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a "traditional" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary';3

'Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for its fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)';3
'The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism.  This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler';3

'I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature. This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:  	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25 	 Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:  	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25 	 This results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75"  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.

'Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.  If youre considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:  For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net.  We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.  The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been unable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting.  If you can get past this problem, youll find the Adobe Premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.  Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If youve ever used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, youll recognize the methodology and the user interface.

'And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root- Bernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule, after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekules.  Many of the predecessors of Kekules structure resemble the modern model more.  I dont think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friends crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteurs discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteurs motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).';2

'Please forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to follow the argument.

One term for that meaning is "Creator", though that is not obvious from my above argument.   (Its more like "I think, therefore I am, therefore God is.")   Unfortunately the term "religious" is ambiguous to me in this context. I could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being religious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on  the search.  If you want "meaning" why not search for the truth?

'I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  Its driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to  do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses Ive been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows whats happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say "Crucify him" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today wed do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were "invited" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian "invitation",  I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows whats happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass were just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay "experts", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--thats just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lords presence.  So weve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I dont mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware  of Gods presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should  just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately?';3
'Somewhere, someone told me that Satan was the angel in charge of music in heaven, and on top of that, he was the most beautiful of the angels.  Isnt it funny that these days how MTV has become the "bible" of music and beauty these days.  MTV controls what bands are popular, no matter how bad they are.  In fact, it is better to be politically correct - like U2, Madonna - than to have any musical talent.  Then of course, you have this television station that tells us all how to dress.  Think about it, who started the retro-fashion craze??  MTV and Madonna.  Gag.  Anyway, just food for thought.  It is really my own wierd theory.  If Revelation was to come true today, I think MTV would the "ever changing waters" (music and fashion world) that the beast would arise from, and Madonna will be the whore of Babylon, riding the beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs.

'[From Kalat, J.W.. (1992):  _Biological Psychology_. Wadsworth Publishing Co. Belmont, CA.  Pg. 219.  Reproduced without permission.]    Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors  Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile,  Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids  (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well.  Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.  A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We  awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

'Well, Ive said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such "murders" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most peoples definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we cant always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isnt objectively perfect.  You see, it doesnt matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I dont think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.';0

'rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSPs) and DNA.  I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think its warranted.  HSPs are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called heat shock proteins is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because its DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.

'All true.  And all good points.    Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanfords Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didnt.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what youve said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzos Oil, offers a perfect example of what Im talking about.  If you havent seen it, you should.  Its not a put down of doctors and neither is what Im saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess Im biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  Thats because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.   Linda lindae@netcom.netcom.com';2

'I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted. Ive been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umars article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that "Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed", with the disclaimer "(fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and "false statements"]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the "ISLAM: a clearer view" thread as well as the root of the "Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they havent read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadnt in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the "a clearer view" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance "Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores"), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but youll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that "TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdies essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course, you are more than welcome to do so.';0

'Printer model and specification:  Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)   Hello,  We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer.  We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The  copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the printer with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript  with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98  rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that  acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript.  We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality  pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a  warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work.   Here my questions:  If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or  parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?  Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer?   The Big question:  Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?    Please email directly to me, I dont not read news on a regular basis.  I will post a summary.

'On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the  same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words and pay attention better  when things get changed around.

Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we dont have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to "just offer  it up" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor  of also trying to satisfy our childrens needs, things get pretty  complicated.  One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still  Mass.';3
'That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.

Thats a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.

Other therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache.  The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than migraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; I suspect that organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in migraine.';2

'I have a Paradise SVGA with 1Mb, the 90c030 chip (1D). The docs say that I can display the following modes : 640x480x32k colours and 800x600x32k cols if I have the RAMDAC HiColor Chip.

The problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the arcs in-between so that as few arcs as possible cross each other.

'Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized swelling, not anaphylactic shock.

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

'Well now, we cant judge death until we are dead right?  So, why should we judge religion without having experienced it?  People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I dont totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.  So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say that it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state above).';0
'Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and subsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friends case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you, and offer you support.';2
'I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,      and the trumpet had blown. I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  "Not tonight Ill get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  "Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men."  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We dont tell people anymore, that theres such a thing as sin or that theres such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesnt mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to "outer darkness.".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didnt prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the "whosoever will" and the nonelect are the "whosoever wonts."  Whether or not thats theologically sound, I couldnt defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, "Ye would not."    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, "I dont believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus."  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  "Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount."  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  Youll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didnt want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, "where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out."  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a "furnace of fire."  It was Jesus that used the word, "condemnation."  "And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  Thats what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, "outer darkness."    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  Thats not what hell is.  Hells not a party.  Theres no fellowship there.  He called it "outer darkness."  "Outer" -away from God.  "Darkness" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  Thats is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an "awesome" thought.    "My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?"  Hell is isolation.  Theres no fellowship in hell.  Theres no friendship in hell.  Theres no loving embrace in hell.  Theres no hand shake in hell.  Theres no word of encouragement in hell.    "I thirst."  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a womans body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  Ive remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasnt his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barbers wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  "They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I cant stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?"  Jack answered by saying, "Yes I think he would!"  Of course the barber said, "What do you mean by that."  "Well if you cant stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where theyll do it for eternity?  Youd be miserable.  Because God loves you, Hed put you where it would match what you really are."   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Dont ask me how, I dont know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the "whosoever wills."  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying "Everybody is going to be saved eventually."  -universalism.  My Bible says no, Hell separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  ".After you die theres a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven."  No, my Bible says that "It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment."  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito youre squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I dont enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you dont enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people arent going there, Id give it to you, but I havent found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore were responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a "uni"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As Ive already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  "Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men."  2)  If you havent accepted Jesus are your Savior, youre taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I dont mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, "Youve got to ask yourself, Do I feel lucky?  Well do you?"  "A mans got to know his limitations."  Dont be one of the "whosoever wonts."';3
'No, I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as belonging to the religion when event being judged applies.

'In fairness, we should note that if you look up "speculum" in the dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first definition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in optical instruments."

'No, theres no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous.  The "evidence" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases in the past.   I like the implication here.  It must not be that the quacks making millions off such "diseases" are biased -- rather that those who doubt their existence dont understand the real world.  It seems easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same thing.  However, I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple quack diseases rise and fall in popularity.  "Systemic yeast syndome" seems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago). There will be new such "diseases" Im sure with best-selling books and expensive therapies.   Well this, of course, is convincing.  I guess Id better start diagnosing any illnesses that people want so that I can keep my lips.';2
'I posted this a couple of weeks ago, and it doesnt seem to have appeared   on the newsgroup, and I havent had a reply from the moderator. We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as "justifiable wars". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I havent answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly Ill be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith "citizens of the commonwealth of Israel"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that "God rules in the kingdoms of   men", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be "strangers and pilgrims" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but thats another story). We   are not supposed to "strive" or "resist evil" (even "suffer yourselves to   be defrauded") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   Gods kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesars and unto God   the things which be Gods" (Luke 20:25). "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God" (Rom 13:1-2). "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to Gods law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are Gods "bond servants" and His   service is our lifes task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to "work heartily as unto the Lord" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. "Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on Gods side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is "testifying" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become "fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to "lay aside every weight" that we may   run "the race that is set before us", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - "Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is "be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says "take my yoke upon you", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says "become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   "Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had "sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   "I am as thou art, my people as thy people" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldnt break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us "Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - Im still looking into   it, as I dont think Ive answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the Kosmos is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with mans weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with Gods armour (Eph6:13-20).  Ill probably post some more when Ive had time to look into things a bit   further.';3

'Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me  as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people group he was serving. WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture in minority languages.  The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this along the lines of "ideological manipulation and cultural interference" is probably no more than Christianising and education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port  	If youve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard 	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then youre going to have a hard time finding 	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation 	runs the X window system, youre in luck.  You can buy a cheap used 	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable 	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read 	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.  	The two main programs Ive found to do this are KT and A2X.  	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and 	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server 	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your 	server can do this, run xdpyinfo and see if any of these strings 	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesnt have this, 	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later, 	or bugging your vendor.  	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers. 	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I havent seen it.  	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals  	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use 	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all 	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the 	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add 	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around 	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT  	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop 	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they 	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of 	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics  	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and 	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I dont 	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  Its not 	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by 	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more 	details.      5. IBM RS/6000  	IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  || 	Unfortunately, you cant just plug one in.  You need two things: a  || 	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   || 	smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe || 	it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it || 	works.  However, they dont want me to redistribute it.  Ive been  || 	told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn || 	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||          6. Other stuff  	Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp) 	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your 	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can 	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either 	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in 	luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.

One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.     The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.      Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PCs and compatibles     (including PS/2s and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I dont have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.

'I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different conclusion. Ive eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce. I thought, "Well, Ive only had scallops once and I was sick after but that could have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor, sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch another scallop. I may not be allergic but I dont want to take the chance.';2

'It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucailles translations (in his book, "The Bible, the Quran and Science") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   "...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion."  (Also note that "the celestial bodies" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translators interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    Youre right, what the verses _do_ contain isnt all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, thats how hes a "Dr.") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Quran as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)';0
'This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the   belief that you cant deny anything that you cant prove doesnt exist.  This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are  conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have  to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe  in objects or beings that havent been proved not to exist so why stop at  God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan  except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond  hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we cant see them)  The   reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians  have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.    How did they shoot themselves in the foot?     There is a big difference here, Stalin didnt say that he stood for a    particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and   then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least   an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this   viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because   one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the   russians that helped Stalin that werent atheists - dont they contradict   your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant   to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists   cant value life as much as theists (which you didnt support).      Ah, and heres another point you didnt get out of the FAQ.  An atheist  doesnt have to hold the positive view that god doesnt exist, he/she may  just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Heres the example:    Strong atheism - "I believe god does not exist"   a positive belief   Weak atheism   - "I dont believe in a god"       a negative belief    these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of  god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that  you are calling unreasonable.  Or lets look at it this way (in sets)    suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent  as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas  exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person  not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that  even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:    christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god    atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)    atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set    agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E, ....)      Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not   will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always    prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival   trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.';0
'I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate respond to the "Charley Challenges" (and judging from my e-mail, there appear to be quite a few of you.)    It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it something similar to the following:      "Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges."

'This is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is  a definition, not an assertion:     Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a     believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is    good. Blah blah blah.  Thats about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To say that something produces only good because it is only good that  it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And all youre application is saying that its true if you really  believe its true.  Thats silly.  Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- dont-believe-it-and-it-doesnt.    Like other religions Im aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of some inaccessible god.  By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.

'According to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income.  Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their followers.

Suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God creating woman, and then saying, "It is not good that woman should be alone. I will make a help meet for her." Feminists would be outraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the Male Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the authors estimate of the relative importance of the sexes. The verdict would have been unequivocal. "No self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist trash!" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered his original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then Eve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day.

'Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they arent of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  Ive known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they wont admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that hed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warrens fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   Im not sure that its random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirskys opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I dont agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps ones jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design.  Id say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, its worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.';2

'Thats ridiculous!   They arent designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853."   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isnt always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages ones health.  Clearly womens bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, arent we wroth!

I wouldnt encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I dont know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values youre advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.';2

'[With Franks permission, I have added some information here (and in one case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based primarily on William Ruschs historical summary in "The Trinitarian Controversy", Fortress.  Im going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY   [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the "Apologists".  Their theology has often been described as "Logos theology".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This "immanent Word" became "expressed" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the "economy").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus views should probably be called "economic trinitarianism", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic Monarchianism   Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of Gods Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Fathers divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The diversity of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end.  Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.  Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]    Modalistic Monarchianism   Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of Gods Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of Gods modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting "three in oneness" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God  Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).  Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christs baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]   [Ive moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  "Economic" Trinitarianism   Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various "neo-economic" Trinitarians Perception of Gods Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of Gods Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as "distinction" and "distribution" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is "eternally generated".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that "there was once when he was not" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate "hypostases", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios ("of the same substance").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origens intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]   Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovahs Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of Gods Essence: The inherent oneness of Gods nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. "Threeness in oneness" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.  Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence.  Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]   Orthodox Trinitarianism   Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of Gods Essence: Gods being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists "undivided in divided persons." This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of "three in oneness." [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origens thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origens, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

'No, Bobby.  Stalin killed millions in the name of Socialism.  Atheism was a characteristic of the Lenin-Stalin version of Socialism, nothing more. Another characteristic of Lenin-Stalin Socialism was the centralization of food distribution.  Would you therefore say that Stalin and Lenin killed millions in the name of rationing bread?  Of course not.    In earlier posts you stated that true (Muslim) believers were incapable of evil.  I suppose if you believe that, you could reason that no one has ever been killed in the name of religion.  What a perfect world you live in, Bobby.      Bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in _The Good Atheists  Handbook_:  Law XXVI.A.3: Give that which you do not believe in a face.    You must excuse us, Bobby.  When we argue against theism, we usually argue against the Christian idea of God.  In the realm of Christianity, man was created in Gods image.';0
'You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make. I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result.    As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science.    If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while youre shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless youve done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,  but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.    And Im especially offended by Russell Turpins repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesnt get you anywhere.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.';2

'Summary of thread: A person has Crohns, raw vegetables cause problems (unspecified) Steve Holland replies:  patient may have mild obstruction.  Avoid things that would plug her up.  Crohns has no dietary restriction in general.   The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.   Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.   The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions. Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are avoided because they may get stuck.  Id go ahead and have the fudge, though ;-)  .  Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohns commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohns.  And, as I always say when dealing with Crohns, as does Spencer, Good Luck!';2
'Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be?  I realize the off-hand nature of the numbers I used.  And I cant answer as to what an acceptable loss rate is.  However,  as I said in another post,  I despise the idea of supporting criminals for life.  Its the economics of the situation that concern me most.  The money spent feeding, clothing, housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to a number of places,  all of which I, and probably others,  would consider far more worthwhile and which would enrish the lives of all Americans.  Give people jobs,  give the homeless shelter.  Any number of things.  Clyde';0

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The programs quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose."    "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesnt have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software."    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files cant be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) Its written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmers environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isnt that   difficult to write your own with their programmers module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratorys Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

'I find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed.  Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder.  He has established a two-tiered God.  One set of rules for the Jews (his people) and another set for the saved Gentiles (his people).  Why would God discriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the Gentile rules.  God has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the law.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law.  Pauls point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can never be used as an instrument of salvation.  And please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one.  In Matt 5:14-19 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was only saying that for the Jewss benefit.  Your Christ must be a politician, speaking from both sides of His mouth.  As Paul said, "I have not so learned Christ."  Forget all the theology, just do what Jesus says.  Your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth, far less in Gods judgement hall.';3
'I know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash.

I try to avoid MSG completely.  Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldnt understand why because I dont MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still love it).

'-*-----   I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by  figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought "virtually impossible to test for."  Indeed, I would be surprised if "candida overbloom" were such a phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the  extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite  tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as  "virtually impossible."';2

'Jesus isnt God ? When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?  What version of the Bible do you read Mike ?  Jesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, I and the Father are one.  Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. Thats why Jesus warned that many would come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns.   These are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve :-)';3

'While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I  have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just  friends level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   Ive had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldnt  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I dont think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, its important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.';3

'Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Lets back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isnt obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasnt happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.';0
'[..]   Hello.  Firstly, what do you exactly mean by "fundamentalist"?  I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is Gods word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what hell call being "born again"?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is "yes" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, Ild rather give advice to your friend! I think Ive been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now "obvious" to him.  What is "obvious" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on "both sides of the fence".  This I mean that before he turned "fundamentalist", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of lets say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, hes got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that hes really putting you off.  [...]   So far, Ive only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasnt a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or "fundamentalists" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, "religious belief" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what hes trying to convince you about, that its beyond you or not your concern "for now".  Dont tell him its nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  Hell also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. Ill admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what Ive found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didnt really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think hes crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesnt see why God cant be real to you too.  I dont know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal conviction: nobody is "beyond saving" except the one we call the  devil and his hosts.';3
'frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank ODwyer) writes ...  While Ill agree that these are generally held to be "good things", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally "good" or "bad".  And when I referred to "the truth" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some "higher authority" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as ones morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following ones own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it.';0

'I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought Id share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, "God Loves You."  Isnt    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  Gods  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in Gods sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  Gods perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesnt  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  Gods    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a days journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Campings book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information helpful:         title:       1994?       author:      Harold Camping       publisher:   Vantage Press       distributor: Baker and Taylor       ISBN:        0-533-10368-1     I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

'Yes, absolutely, though Id make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases.   But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,  to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.   My point isnt so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how*  you come about developing it.   Perhaps youd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, Im making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesnt make any basic  assumptions that arent the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  "the old Newtonian model of the world".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical "world view".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   Theres nothing at all surprising about this, its the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people wont have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research cant seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a  creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.';2

'My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. Weve kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, thisll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what Ive seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But its hard.    From time to time Ive wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but Ive always thought, "Why be dramatic? And you know hell only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back." Its been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasnt going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didnt want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time shes ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if shes divorced my brother, and that its a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. Im proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that hes willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they cant "get away" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they cant see a way out of--or they cant bear to take whatever paths they do see. And Im frustrated because I dont know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; Im having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Heres the big question Ive been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.   Thank you.';3

'I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  Im going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).  	1. Review Article "Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney  	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev. 	   5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.  	2. "Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in  	    patients with kidney stones" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988) 	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary  	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.  	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" Clin. Sci. 38 	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day  	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day  increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we dont know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.  	Here are the high oxalate foods:  	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea. 	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams  	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,  	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe. 	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldnt  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.  	4. "The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of  patients with calcium oxalate calculi"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)  	5. "Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the  crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium  interaction"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).  	6.Review Article, "Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment  of renal calcium stones" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).  There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesnt read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney  stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought  Id tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctors office.

'Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of Moody Bible Institute:    There has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of "arrogance" is aimed at.  The arrogance being attacked is that we "think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as "how do you know?"  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Lets take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered "absolutely certain".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Lets go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: "how do you know?"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:   A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.   B: How do you know?   A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church     teachings and came to this conclusion.   B: How do you know you studied history correctly?   A: Well, I double-checked everything.   B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?   A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.   B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesnt mean it is     true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?   A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say "I cant prove that there are no mistakes" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the "arrogance of Christians" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant.';3
'I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasnt that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few  minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  Ill take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.  Im 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen.  So that cant be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms (I hope)?  Has this happened to anyone else?

'[Please, note the Newsgroups.]  Recent discussion about XVs problems were held in some newsgroup. Here is some text users of XV might find interesting. I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even you so my articles a while ago.  I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fine program XV is that it is worth of improving. (I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)  Any misundertanding of mine is understandable.   Juhana Kouhia   ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  Note that xv saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also, theres three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too.   This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.   IMHO, it is design error of xv; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. Theres two errors:   -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of    original 24bit should be a special case   -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer    -- the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases    in saving the image, if at all)   ==clip==  ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design. It is error in design. It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that.  As matter of fact, Im sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. That were not done and now we have  -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)  -the program has human interface errors.  Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.  [ ..deleted.. ]  ==clip==  Some new items follows.  ==clip==  I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant.  If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.  I dont know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no. So, use of XVs -best24 option is not very good idea.  I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- Im sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I can say nothing about it.)  ==clip==  ==clip==  Some minor bugs in human interface are:  Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.  Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is completed. Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when Im writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.  In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first and then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet. I suggest of adding an apply button to update the exchanges done.';1

'I attribute my success to several factors:  Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (Ive heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I dont still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I dont eat when Im not hungry (unless Im sure Ill get hungry shortly, and eating wont be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as Ive never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when Im at rest Im most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But its easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  Theres no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isnt different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I cant swear that every obese person who does what Ive done will have the success I did.  But Ive never yet heard of one who did try it and didnt succeed.   Im sure everyones weight cycles, whether or not theyve ever been fat. I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes off again over a week or two. --  Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com';2

'An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by   evangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his   interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He   interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good   old U. S. of A.  Thats right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.    The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the   WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese   success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the   world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldnt the whole world mourn?  The bible   also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am   paraphrasing, of course).  Babylons sin affected, or should I say, infected,   the whole world.  It doesnt take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a   state of moral decay.  Hasnt the American culture and Hollywood spread the "do   it if it feels good" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what   Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls   Babylon "Babylon the Great" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on   earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I   dont think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the   most powerful nation on earth.  Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy   of consideration.';3

'From article <1993Apr22.233001.13436@vax.oxford.ac.uk>, by krishnas@vax.oxford.ac.uk: The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little  fat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  Im not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if its a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesnt feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope itll help you.

'At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where were continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists "believe" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what Im trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  Im a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).';0

A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.  Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one.  Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).   Algorithm:  Is the sphere well defined?     (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).     (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).     (3) Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it (=> failure). Yes. Find its centre.     (1) Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.     (2) Find their point of intersection (P).     (3) Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P (line N).     (4) Find the plane containing N and D; find the point E on the 	ABC circle in this plane (if D lies on N, take E as A).     (4) Find the perpendicular bisector of ED (line L)     (5) Find the point of intersection of N and L (Q). Q is the centre of the desired sphere   Pictures:  (1) In the plane ABC  			A                                   P                                   B                               C  (2) At right-angles to ABC, in the plane containing N and D  			E                                                             D      line N     --------------------P-------------Q---------------------------   Numerically:  If ED << EP then Q will be very close to P (relative to the radius of the ABC circle) and subject to error. Its best to choose D so that the least of AD, BD and CD is larger than for any other choice.';1
'Koberg,  	Just a couple of minor corrections here...  	1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.  	2)  Im not sure what you mean by "signifying believers"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is "Baptized in the Holy Spirit"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about "these signs following them that believe" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you dont pactice the signs you arent "saved".  	3)  I know its hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think youve made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do "Neo-Pentecostals" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  Ive never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.';3

'But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a non-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melindas and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.  Personally, I dont mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine and we can all live peacefully.';3

'******* *******  This is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *******    Boy am i glad you decided to read this. Ive got a problem that  I need as many peoples help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (Shes one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although Im  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it cant be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   "Okay, now Im going to try to explain my life to you. Im not going to KU anymore because something just isnt right. College just wasnt clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and that just isnt my way. I wasnt taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with  kids, but it just didnt work for me at this university. And my parents could tell.  "So Im working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room M-W-F. Ive really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and  its great experience.  "As of now, Im not planning on going back to school in the very near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it wont be to Kansas.  "Right noew Im discussing a promotion with my boss and district  manager. It looks like Ill train at the store I work at now for about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when thats done, Ill  basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to  chose where i would like to manage. Ive pretty much decided on either one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldnt it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years?? What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.  "This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up  paying out of state tuition wherever I go.  "Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I  respect your opinion. Ive been completely lost for what to do for  soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really  good. I do like my job although Im about 99.9% sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something. I dont think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female is too bad.   "Anyway, onto your career decisions. Ill solve your problem right now, MARRY ME...  "You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously (or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the home life later."  ***********  OK, well Im sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you think she meant about the marraige thing??   I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her letter!!! I dont know what to think??  Since she wants to move to the Carolinas should i search out a  Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???  I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married....but what does she mean???   Ive had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that  I dont date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the Greeks whic as a Christian I cant support-----and here she says she doesnt like the Greek thing either!!  Maybe Im so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am so attracted to paying some real attention to me.  I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? Im only 19 and she 20....Im only a Sophmore struggling through classes..  I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time.. saying, "God if she is the right one, let the situation open up.."  Could this be my sign???  I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes  it worse..  Should I call her?? Im terrible over the phone. I dont even like to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.  I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me??  Im really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.  Thanx   Chris';3

'I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as Gods sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as Gods revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luthers right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked. 	But recently I read Peter Browns _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than todays carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body,  totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings.  	now the question is this: were the first Christians just as weird, but weve got used to them, or did the pristine "Fall of the Church" happen within one generation. It certainly didnt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does  this say about Gods promise to always support the Church. Its no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. Its a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison. 	I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. Im not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their "soul alone with Jesus" approach, but for we who see the "ecclesia" as a "koinoia" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem.  [This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  "The soul alone with God" is certainly important for Protestants, but its by no means the whole story.  I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out, Protestants dont have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, youll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think youll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was "wierd".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I dont much want to talk about in this context, since its been looked at recently -- thats the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought.)  One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think theres good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think theres good reason to think that many Christians were happily married.  I cant help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now.  I think theres also a certain level of "revisionism" active in history at the moment.  I dont mean that theyre manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But dont you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?';3

'Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association "Spectrum" offer        VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of        controllers.                       SOFTWARE              For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit        includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.             Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for        non professional users.             There are next possibility:        - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;        - read - white image to - from disk;        - print image on the printer;        - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;        - filter image;        - work with gistogramme;        - edit image.        - include users exe modules.                       CONTROLLER VS9         The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.        VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from        a field of 724x600 pixels.        The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in        the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.

'OFM replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible,   Unfortunately, this isnt true.  On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations.

'As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.    This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?       First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I dont think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks ones attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.';2

'Rick has nailed the problem down pretty well.  As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.    It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage: husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for "connectedness" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  Thats part of the concept from Hebrews about "not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some."  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I dont see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon "I am a rock, I am an island..." model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of "evil" (I Thess 5:22)  So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the  conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant.

'This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.   The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Korans version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, ("forty days and forty nights", "pair of every animal", etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Korans description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as "A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage".  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.  The above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.    --';0

': Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me  : as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with : translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people : group he was serving. : WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture : in minority languages.  Yes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my church. I would fully endorse the above -- Peter is a very Godly man, with a passion for serving Christ.  On one occasion he specifically addressed the issue of ``cultural interference in a sermon, presumably from his experience of allegations directed at Wycliffe. (Perhaps I could find the tape...?)';3
'Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB that was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didnt spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."';2
'This is an excellent question and Ill be anxious to see if there are any such cases.  I doubt it.  In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent. when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone "knew the rules."

'I apologize if this article is slightly confusing, and late. The origonal draft didnt make it through the moderators quote-screens. So I did violence to it, but if you remember the article I am responding to it should still make sence.   What, no hello for heathan netters?  I feel all left out now. :(  [deletia- table of content, intro, homosexuality]   [deletia- incorrect attributions]  Uh, you have your attributions wrong, you were responding to my article, so Dan Johnson should be the 1st one.   [deletia- no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat.]   Ah, in the _cosmic_ sence.. but who lives in the cosmic sence? Not me! Cosmicly, we dont even exist for all practical purposes. I can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life. It would just say: "dont bother."  Luckily for mortals, there are many sences of scale you can talk about. In a human sence, you can have big purposes.   But the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar and countless others is still with us, although their works have perished.  But they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists, their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if they are utterly forgotten.   One day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, which I do not)  But in that time we can make a difference.   In the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all the point you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobody to ask, "Gee, I dont think James Sledds deeds are gonna make much of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?".  But they will have already have made a difference, great or small, before the end.  Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?   Little is in the eye of the beholder, of course.   I dont doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. And it does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.   I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely my definitions. Heres what I think the relevant terms are:  "Reality"	That which is real. "Illusion"	That which is not real, but seems to be. "Real"		Objectively Existing  For "reality" to be an "illusion" would mean, then:  That which is real is not real, but seems to be.  Or:  That which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, but does seem to objectively exist.  From which we can conclude, that unless you want to get a contradiction, that no things objectively exist.  But I have a problem with this because I would like to say that *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sum and all that.  Perhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean: "Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans."  Which is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.   Have on. If reality is an illusion, isnt True Reality an illusion too? And if True Reality is spirit, doenst that make Spirit an Illusion as well?  If I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.   That is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.  Do you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so, please show that this is true. If not, please explain how this can give a purpose to anything.   How does it do that?  Wouldnt the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation for some *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.   What pressure?   It is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be achived.  Indeed, many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Check out yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is not at all the same thing.   Why is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in this goal? To you? To God? To the mysterious Purpose?   [deletia- question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was  mostly quote.]   Ill have a crack at that.  (1) The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name: It is the concept of life without death, life without end.  (2) No. We can put together word to describe it, but we cannot imagine it.

'Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me...  I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that "my weekend" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasnt a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated "effectively".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to "drive her from the fold", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (Im not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope youve had a happy Easter.

If you have questions, you want to send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan     		    Software Tools to help with RSI 		    -------------------------------   This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.     Richard Donkin                            Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk               Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853  Changes in this version:       Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool       for Windows.   TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you dont have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from: 	Bright Star 	Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description: 	Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.  	Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations 	on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best  	with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible 	to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from: 	Media Vision 	Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description: 	A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port. 	Includes At Your Service.       Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)     Available from: 	Escape Ergonomics, Inc 	1111 W. El Camino Real 	Suite 109 	Mailstop 403 	Sunnyvale, CA 	Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description: 	Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take 	breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or 	after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier. 	It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from 	a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work 	you do - data entry, word processing, information processing. 	Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on 	how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.  	CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use  	to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information 	on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer. 	A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.  	CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then 	warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear 	useful when used with Windows.  	Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments: 	The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better 	to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to 	measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff 	is very good and includes some summaries of research papers, 	as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company  	to pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from: 	RAN Enterprises 	One Woodland Park Dr. 	Haverhill, MA  01830, US 	Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description: 	Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take 	breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally 	displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are 	animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the 	correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training  	exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions 	you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help  	on workplace ergonomics.    	Quote from their literature:  	"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic 	sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work 	all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent 	Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve 	your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these 	help you to become more relaxed and productive."   	"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C. 	Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup 	for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to 	promote healthy and efficient computer use.  	 	Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts 	for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments: 	I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say 	it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it 	does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it 	interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which 	is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on 	Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure 	why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has 	one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not 	require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from: 	Visionary Software 	P.O. Box 69447 	Portland, OR  97201, US 	Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200     Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)     Description: 	Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break 	with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises 	to do during breaks, and information on configuring your 	workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59; 	quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is 	bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how 	equivalent this is to the Mac version. 	 	The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher  	Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful  	2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with  	references.

Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)      Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)     Description: 	Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take 	breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).  	Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are 	animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the 	correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones 	are included to some extent.  Online help.  	Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based 	on this.  	Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. 	      (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments: 	I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface 	design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual. 	expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only 	tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it 	on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers! 	Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does  	have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence, 	which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from: 	Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk 	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description: 	This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you 	to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously 	typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check 	that you really do take a break, and tells you when you 	can start typing again.    	Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing 	today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you 	know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information 	to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.    	The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode), 	in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message 	(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>  	has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for  	X, Zephyr and Mach.  	Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk 	(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach, 	X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give  	feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from: 	Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description: 	Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming 	appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool. 	Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit 	a program to run at a specific time to display a message to 	the screen.  	Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and 	include this filename in your WIN.INIs load= line so 	you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you 	want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am. 	Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter 	9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break 	is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat  	for the next appointment.  	By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes 	that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this 	file on your run= line, as above, and you will then, with 	a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments 	with RSI exercises.  	The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.  	An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job 	that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will 	depend a lot on your operating system.  	While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing  	yourself to take a break if you cant get hold of a suitable RSI  	management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to 	write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating 	system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from: 	Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description: 	Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable 	number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either 	manually or automatically.    	While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you 	are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from 	a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great 	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you 	are doing. 	     Comments: 	My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to 	my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which 	actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left 	arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been 	very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.  	I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but 	these are not much good because they do not give an audible 	warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from: 	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (dont know which ones)     Description: 	Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. 	Only works through ttys (so, you can use it with a terminal or 	an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from: 	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c 	Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description: 	The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout 	that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent 	RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since  	it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)';2

'Gordon Banks:  This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but smaller and larger cycles occur as well. Im always afraid that this method will stop working someday, but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting (that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle- dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.  I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.';2
'Hi, I am not sure where to post this message, please contact me if Im way off the mark. On 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner (Doctor). He mentioned an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. He had read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again. The article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain. It mentions the use of a MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain. This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal. I very much want to obtain the name of the article, journal and author because the case matches my wife.

'I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what its worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although Im sure its possible to argue theologically that we shouldnt make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldnt discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderators FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but "love the sinner" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  Im not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.';3

'DN> From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) DN> A neurology DN> consultation is cheaper than a scan.  And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis.  DN> >>Also, since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other DN> >>serious pathology, it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have DN> >>them come into the ER every few weeks. DN> And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient, right? DN> Personally, I dont think this can ever be justified.  Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis, salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why cant you order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?"  Aunt Millie often gets into the conversation, as in "they ignored Aunt Millies headaches for years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, Id like to hear what your magic is.  Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG. Mind you, I dont think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor, but the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if the hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were "nothing"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, its *much* cheaper than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.';2

'A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a "plug and patch".  The doctor considered the procedure a success.  A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.  Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldnt identify any specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.  My question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else?';2

'Ive heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event. (About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still cant help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr   Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels arent dated, so we can only guess.  Lukes prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly dont have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peters sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that Im not sure how much reliance Id put on the methods used.  But its common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.';3

'Julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described.  My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include:    have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really dont understand where youre coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....)    dont accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)    find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.)    Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  Its just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  Its sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you cant give one side everything; there must be a compromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.';3

'Its like refusing Gods kingdom come.  In one of Jesus revelation in this century, "...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be enlightened enough to detect which ones are  authentic and divine as opposed to evil or man-made.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why cant someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing Gods messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why cant we tolerate non-believers mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? Wed rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each others   opinion - looking at each others mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend Gods rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isnt that like an atheist/agnostics view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   "We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__." but then she continues:   "You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__." Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   "prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings."? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   "Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word." Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   "The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord."  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   "You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you." but she follows this with:   "You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day." Why does she constantly conveys:   "Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   "Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer."  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   Gods commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for Gods current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Havent there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christs   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldnt we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to Gods children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Sons coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   "If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you."   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Lets not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there wont be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  "Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children." Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son."                                                                          And you think shes just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  Shes our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share Gods kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from "Latest News of Medjugorje"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr. Rene Laurentin.  -----';3

'[...]  Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action where we cross someones border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally "invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation "invades" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).  [...]  No, its someone who believes in "peace-at-all-costs".  In other words, a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political  dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.  "Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  Well, it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if youd rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrants heel, then yes, its "bad" to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with  the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and  many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)  All to stop we "warmongers" who are willing to stand up  and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do so requires a strong national defense.  Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)  [...]  Regards,';0

'---  	Then let me ask you for a "workable" solution.  We have a name here that implies certain things to many people.  Rather than trying to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there some "name" that would imply what this group was originally intended for?    	My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler for "meaning".

But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution -- what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to discuss?

'I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Quran  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Quran says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Quran is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Quran makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.';0

Is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?  If the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can  explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, and which truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these  determinations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical  Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding  Biblical interpretation.

'Not to drag this out anymore, but....  Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.  A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to "prove" that the disease exists.  This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:  1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesnt have the same chronicity that some see in humans.  2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy.  Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so.';2

'First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smiths posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is likely. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be true in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere best fits for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one cant believe without Gods help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. Im afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: "Why nothing exists?" This is equivalent to my counter-question, "why nothing exists in nothingness".   Now, "why anything exists" is equivalent to "why something exists in somethingness".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question "why this, and not that", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human beings existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, Ive yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like I exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesnt, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  "why do I exist, in particular" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I cant just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think "pre-existence" is an oxymoron. There is no time outside of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, "why do I believe" or "why I dont believe".   Petri';3

'Crullerian.   Crullerian photography isnt educational, except in a purely satiric sense.   Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope. Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes, and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes. Some people believe that food is the way to a mans heart, but most psychics agree that there is nothing like hot Crullers for breakfast; the chemical composition of crullers is a mystery, some thought evidence of Charles Forts channeling in Stevie Wonders production of "The Secret Life of Plants" when played backwards in the theatre of unnaturally fertile Findhorn Farms has deduced that they are complex carbohydrates ordinarily only found by spectoscopy in the Magellenic Clouds.

'Hi Damon,  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation from nothing, or creation from something.  There are no other alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan.    If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call that intelligence God.    I also prefer the "Creatio ex nihilo" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner.    There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and we must have come from somewhere.

'The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).  And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of Gods plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But dont forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Dont you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene, tekel, peres?"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of Gods justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me."  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, "well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans."  He said "Follow me."  His message is NOT "Im just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, youve got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, thats only a fairy tale."  "Our great God and Savior" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.';3

'My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.    Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.   (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:    Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God   imputeth righteousness without works,   Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins   are covered.   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   Im sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  Youre suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  Ill leave comments on the so-called "bema seat" vs. "throne" judgments to someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism.';3
'Dont listen to this guy, hes just a crank.  At first, this business about being the "one true god" was tolerated by the rest of us, but now it has gotten completely out of hand.  Besides, it really isnt so bad when people stop believing in you. Its much more relaxing when mortals arent always begging you for favors.';0
'Ah, now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario.   We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your own words) This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck, makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years.)  Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.   Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly nothing to this revelation thing?    Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?   Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.  Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake?   Sincerely,   Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu';0

'I wrote in response to dlecoint@garnet.acns.fsu.edu (Darius_Lecointe):   Was Paul a God too? Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher priority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt5:14-19? Paul begins Romans 14 with "If someone is weak in the faith ..." Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?   Yes, but what does the Bible have to say? What did Jesus say? Paul closes Romans 14 with, "On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isnt acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin." Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2 Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law? Have you read Jesus word in Matt5:14-19? Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?   Whereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly clear, are they not?   Matt5:14-19 doesnt answer your question?   Breaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.   How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesuss word in Matt5:14-19?   Or, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus word in Matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were "strong in the faith?"  ---------------------------  [No, I dont believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didnt say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didnt apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a "God-fearer", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However theres more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Pauls apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isnt one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that thats not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately its an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Pauls comments are not the worlds clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, its important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, its not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact thats not Jesus approach.  Jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Pauls conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the "ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, hes looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  Its unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term "Law", any more than people who concerned about the "family values" movement are really opposed to family values.';3

'Having been gone for 10 days, Im way behind on my News reading, so many pardons if I am repeating something that has been said already.  I read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS ARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum Press, ISBN:0-306-44331-7.  It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It is interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to this particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough to understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in microbiology or medicine. Table of contents:  Chapter 1 	From Tragedy the Antibiotic Age is Born Chapter 2 	The Disease and the Cure:  The Microscopic World of Bacteria and 	Antibiotics Chapter 3 	Reliance on Medicine and Self-Medication: The Seeds of Antibiotic 	Misuse Chapter 4 	Antibiotic Resistance:  Microbial Adaptation and Evolution Chapter 5 	The Antibiotic Myth Chapter 6 	Antibiotics, Animals and the Resistance Gene Pool Chapter 7 	Further Ecological Considerations:  Antibiotic Use in Agriculture, 	Aquaculture, Pets, and Minor Animal Species Chapter 8 	Future Prospects:  New Advances Against Potential Disaster Chapter 9 	The Individual and Antibiotic Resistance Chapter 10 	Antibiotic Resistance: A Societal Issue at Local, National, and 	International Levels.

'<<Posting deleted.  The moderator replies:  That is generally accuate, but contains one serious error.  We Catholics do believe that Gods revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newmans _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.  It was recently reprinted as a Doubleday Image Books paperback with some related shorter works under the title _Conscience, Consensus, and the Development of Doctrine_. ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu';3
':  [ . . . . . ] : : Personally, I feel that since religion have such a poweful : psychological effect, we should let theists be.  But the problem is that : religions cause enormous harm to non-believers and to humanity as a whole : (holy wars, inquisitions, inter-religious hatred, impedence of science : & intellectual progress, us-&-them attitudes etc etc.  Need I say more?). : I really dont know what we can do about them.  Any comments? :     I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax anybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You dont get an atheist knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out literature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of happy should work for others and try to make it so.     My sister is a  born again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family for several years. She finally got the clue that she couldnt help. During that period she bought me "I was atheist, now Im Xtian" books for my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would contain verses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send my sister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a "Dont you dare". My mom wasnt religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??     Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to preach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit. I finally told my sister that I didnt find her way of life attractive. I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.     Im sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST OF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists. There must be an end in sight.';0
'A "new Christian" wrote that he was new to the faith and  learning about it "by reading the Bible, of course". I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow. 	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the  revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible. 	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles. 	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading. 	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I  would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greenes _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.';3
'I dont mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me  that youre getting all wound up in a non-issue.    As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because its a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wifes theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I dont believe its ALWAYS the reason its  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   You dont know much about cats, do you?   Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never   understand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.    I also suspect, though its been a while since Ive checked ingredients  on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements  on pet food additives than human.    See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence  to look out after their own interests.';2
'As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, Im posting here.  On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were "melting in fear."  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldnt be so troubled about the reports of "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldnt be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing Gods work?';3
'Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:  1) "I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel."     -Genesis 3.15  2) "He who commits sin is of the devil ..."     -1 John 3.8  3) "Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ..."     -Luke 1.28     From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.    First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan. "[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him." John 8.44.  Now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and "the woman", and enmity between Satan and "her seed."  Now the woman is both Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve.  "Her seed" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she wasnt she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to Christs sinlessness would be called into question, as would Gods veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.     Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel "full of grace."  As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word "Kecharitomene" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, "Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace."  But that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, "you who have been" Mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.     It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in "Ineffibilus Deus."';3

'True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  Its like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was "nice and clean" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here "militarily justified".  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning "morally justified". I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  Ive always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japans island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb couldve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the USs ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I dont regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldnt intervene.  Not that we dont care, but we cant be the worlds policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldnt have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the Wests oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  Im not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but thats The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because were not the saviors of the world.  We cant police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and Ill support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of "sucking up to them" as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  Im not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but lets not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  "Peers" doesnt mean "those who do the same thing", like having murderers judge murderers.  It means "having people from the same station in life", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendents motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word "conspiracy".  I dont accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didnt say that its a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we dont live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didnt say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  Im not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (lets say) we now know.  That doesnt mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didnt see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But dont assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I dont!  I just dont condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I dont believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  "so deplorable".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasnt accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.  Regards,';0

'Basically, any prophet Ive ever dealt with has either been busy  hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in  Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.   Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought  from this dude (you guessed it, a prophet) named Mohammed.  Ive got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks, then Manny,  my mechanic, tells me it was loaded with sawdust!  Take a guess whether "Mohammed" was anywhere to be found.  I dont think so.   Oh, Mohammed!   Yeah, you, Mohammed!   You slimy mass of pond scum!   Yeah, right!  Youre the one should be watching your butt.  You and your buddy Allah.  The stereo he sold me croaked after two days. Your ass is grass!  Jim';0
'Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on: Is there such a thing as a justifible war?   What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: "All war   is wrong", or "Some war is justifiable".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a real flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to Gods commandments to love one another, especially ones enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A Stealh bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddams   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Migs in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a target. Dead civilians are collateral damage. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on justifiable war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War 	- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped. 	- Massive civilian casualties on both sides  		- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki 	- Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war 	- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically 	  communism vs. capitalism. 	- Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam 	- As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. 	- Genocide by Khmer Rouge. 	- Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm) 	- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply 	- Other factors such as genocide. 	- Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia 	- Genocide - so called Ethnic Cleansing 	- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties. 	- Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel. 	- My feelings in this are simple 	- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent 	- I love the New Zealand governments stand on banning all nuclear 	  armed or powered warships from NZ port. 	- Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *dont* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).  Thanks for your help.  ==========================================================================                                     | Alastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347 Chief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529 The Black Albatross Porject,        | University of Otago,                | Department of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz P.O.

'[More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that dont match my experience.  That doesnt make them false.  They just dont match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I dont know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isnt a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

'Archive-name: atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name: introduction Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                            An Introduction to Atheism                        by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>  This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  "What is atheism?"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong atheism".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  "But isnt disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesnt exist?"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  "What is agnosticism then?"  The term agnosticism was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only when referring to "strong atheism".  Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists dont believe in God.  For example, it certainly isnt the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  "So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, its best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  "But isnt it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isnt there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they dont exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they dont believe in unicorns, even though they cant conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesnt exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  "But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that dont exist?  "OK, you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isnt it still a religious belief?"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "the redefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it cant be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isnt atheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by "religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ Its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   "religion" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of "religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  "OK, so its not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?"  Firstly, its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called "acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesnt really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  "If atheism is not religious, surely its anti-religious?"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or "against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  "But if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely thats the same as state atheism?"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  "What about prayer in schools? If theres no God, why do you care if people  pray?"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who dont pray cant just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  "You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Dont  atheists object to the religious charities?"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that its somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is a rather strange idea; its rather like holding a party to say "Today is not my birthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  "You said atheism isnt anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  ones upbringing, a way of rebelling?"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  Its also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  "How do atheists differ from religious people?"  They dont believe in God.  Thats all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  "Unexceptional? But arent atheists less moral than religious people?"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they dont obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable ("wrong") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They dont know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever."  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  "Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"  If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world ought to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  "Then arent atheists just theists who are denying God?"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individuals personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  "But dont atheists want to believe in God?"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the "Big Brother" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  "But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just arent looking properly" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  "Isnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thing that has a "meaning".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is the meaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  "So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, its a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, thats just hard luck.  "Dont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"  The short answer is "No, do you?"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  "So why should theists question their beliefs? Dont the same arguments  apply?"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  "What sort of harm?"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  Its not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Churchs opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  "Those werent REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse."  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions its hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide whos a REAL Christian and who isnt, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England cant decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it cant be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldnt he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs arent a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  "Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns dont exist, but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  "Well, if atheisms so great, why are there so many theists?"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct" it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, theres more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  "But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, its worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so its rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  "What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  "So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  "Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, its up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as its probably the only one youll have.     Its no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good.     If you must assume something, assume something its easy to test.     Dont believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

'To recapitulate a bit:  - The essence of marriage is two peoples commitment to each other.  - If two people claim to be married "in their hearts" but are not   willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state, thats   prima facie evidence that the commitment isnt really there.  - There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible   without a civil or church wedding: if youre stranded on a desert   island, or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason   (e.g., laws against interracial marriage).  - The legal concept of "common-law marriage" is meant to ensure that   the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the   usual ceremony and record-keeping.  - Pastorally, Im concerned that people should not use "being married   in Gods eyes" as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding.

'First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiahs teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and Gods providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the Worlds religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: "is he the one who is to come or do we look for another". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didnt even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  Gods restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, Gods representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe hes already here.';3

'Im not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because Ive seen it drive - Ive done more than at in fact - Ive actually driven it. (now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of whats out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I dont believe its entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The "pink unicorn" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  "pink unicorns" dont exist because I havent seen them, this conclusion has its foundation in observation and theory. A "pink unicorn", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from "more primitive" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I havent defined God as existence - in fact, I havent defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think its relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what Im saying. Im making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. Im not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have "evidence" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I dont follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didnt know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that "God does not exist". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that "god is is meaningful" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a "theist"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.';0
'##I strongly suggest that you look up a book called THE BIBLE, THE QURAN, AND ##SCIENCE by Maurice Baucaille, a French surgeon.  It is not comprehensive, ##but, it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it ##for you through interlibrary loan. ##    I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)  ##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre- ##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that ##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by- ##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didnt go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Quran (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had ##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he ##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Quran, but, ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he ##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to ##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after ##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by ##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that, ##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Quran had to ##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the ##Holy Quran did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in ##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known ##what *not to include* in the Holy Quran (assuming he had authored ##it)?   ##      So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from science.

'( in <1993Apr16.163729.867@batman.bmd.trw.com> )   ( responding to Dave "First With Official A.A Nickname" Fuller )   [ ... ]  That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.  I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement for capital punishment.  Those who dont want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this option.';0
'[insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little relevance to what Ive found]  OK.  The people before Jesus didnt have Jesus, right (so far, Ive announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  "I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it." (John 14:12-14) So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that "there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time." (1 Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, "there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." (Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus being our mediator rather than any other man.  Joe Fisher';3
'KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart) KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information  Im not sure that this condition is "recognised" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.  Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.  Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio.  The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.  There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these "acute" changes in a "chronic" disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years.  There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests.  My take on this (Im sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints).';2

'All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  While  most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RDs who  are in "private practice" so to speak.

'From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in "The Australian Muslim Times", the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I dont deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say "Muslim".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a "Muslim" and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term "Muslim" is to be contrasted with "Mumin", which means "true believer".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mumin is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mumin used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a "true believer" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say "Muslims" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By "Muslim" we do not necessarily mean "Mumin", or "true believer" in Islam.';0

'This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was "a beautiful black queen."  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled "Was Cleopatra Black?"  (The answer to the title is "no"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the "Black Madonna" doesnt represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are "white" (i.e., of the racists "race").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I dont think that this "Jesus was white" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to ones own racial group.';3

'The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly, too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.  This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasnt enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.

'No.  Thats *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).

What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  Im also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but Im just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe its because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we arent entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.

'But why do you characterize this as a "flight of fancy" or a "fantasy"? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy.   Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, "extra-scientific", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a "surprising" experiment is, what counts as "surprising", etc. The same may be said about "logical grounds".  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricellis Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air" hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) "surprising"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like.';2

'A few points about Marys being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth:  One piece of evidence for Marys assumption into heaven is the fact that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christs act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.';3

'Not quite correct.  Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the resurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.  Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead."  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." Those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in newness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan goddess in the process.  Paul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abrahams seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law?  Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.

'Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.   You have to be very careful about what you mean by "question authority". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say "I question to word of this authority" is ridiculous. If it is  open to question, it isnt an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be "authenticate authority." Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.   The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You  can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and  other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,  because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I dont need an  authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.   In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we dont have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to  verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source  ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.   To demand scintific or rational proof of Gods existence, is to deny Gods existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.';3
'Id love to know how "Jesus only" proponents would answer questions like:  -Who is this "Father" Jesus keeps referring to? Why does He call Himself "the Son"?  -Why does He pray to the Father, and not to himself?  -Why does He emphasize that he does his Fathers will, and not his own?  If He  was doing his own will, what kind of example is that?  Should we follow it?  -When He says he has to return to the Father, who is He going to?  -When He says he does this in order that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit might  come, who might that be?  -If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that its  worth His leaving us and returning to the Father, what can that mean if there  is no Holy Spirit?  -Why doesnt the best known Christian prayer begin "Our Saviour, who art in  heaven," rather than "Our Father?"  Do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible?

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

': Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor? :  : Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. : I took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The  : clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the  : doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not  : see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed  : here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several  : trips to the back room, the receptionist told me: : 	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back, : 	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going : 	  to the emergency room; : 	- the doctor would not even speak to me; : 	- she would not tell me the doctors name, or her own name; : 	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I dont know." :  : I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but : I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to : be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.    Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above behavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive care shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate care. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its posted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the clinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing to gain from angering patients.';2

'The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didnt hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraqs military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I dont hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, its becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  Thats war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like its one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, "I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  Im sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldnt have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and youd be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind dont understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi peoples sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map wouldve been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of "not guilty"? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of ones guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,';0

'I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are  every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of  disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.

'Dyer, youre rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. Its often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. Its an educated guess, by a trained person, but its still no more than a guess. Its cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who dont respond.  There are diseases that havent been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described arent known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then its the patients freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose.

'Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces  when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate  substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.    Phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to  degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it will  accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until around age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily  detected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child, or when pregnant.';2
'Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christs message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bibles message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasnt for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I wont name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please dont point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- *****';3

Or perhaps you think that when youre dead      you just stay in you grave. Is God just a thought within you read in a book      when you were at school? When you think about death       Do you lose your breath      Or do you keep your cool?  Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope? Do you think hes a fool? Well I have seen the truth.  Yes I have seen the light      and Ive changed my ways. And Ill be prepared       When youre lonely and scared      at the end of your days.  Could it be youre afraid of what your friends might say If they knew you believed in God above? They should realize before they criticise That God is the only way to love.   Is your mind so small that you have to fall In with the pack wherever they run? Will you still sneer when death is near And say they may as well worship the sun?  I think it was true -it was people like you      that crucified Christ. I think it is sad the opinion you had      was the only one voiced. Will you be so sure when your day is near      to say you dont believe? You had the chance but you turned it down      now you cant retrieve. Perhaps youll think before you say that God is dead & gone Open your eyes, just realize that He is the one. The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate. Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes!  I think its too late.   LORD OF THIS WORLD';3
'Serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.  Whole blood 	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10  	percent lower).  I find the following range for whole blood in 	FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: N. W. Teitz, editor; W. B. 	Saunders, 1987:  	Human glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.   	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not 	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is 	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the 	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz, 	however, results compare "reasonably well" with laboratory results, 	although "values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests, 	whereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic."   	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10  	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect 	whole blood levels, however.  I dont believe there is a well- 	defined "conversion factor," since cell metabolism will affect 	samples to varying degrees.  The serum/plasma test is much  	preferred for any except general "ball park" testing.';2

'Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I dont see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (Im not sure exactly what is referred to here, but Ill take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke "Q" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus mouth.   The version of the "usual theory" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and "Q".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldnt have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, Id be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.     Im not really impressed with the "theology" argument.  But Im really pointing this out as an "if".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.    The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.   But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, its agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.';0
'Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also  widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.  And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is  indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a   perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might  make that he is unable to even leave the house.    In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible  and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these  discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata  --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.    If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and  Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither  of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since  they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of  a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.  It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid  grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton  and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great  deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost  through the mistakes they made.     These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If its not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then its not science."  Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies  are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification  of science.    For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology  results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside  the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have  no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I dont in the least believe that this  is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless,  it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has  certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish  arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment  --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come  with anything worthwhile.    Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.  For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpins assertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.")  I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental  error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the  others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all  too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are  worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.';2

'There is another way to view this.  The True Celebration is Easter, the Resurrection of Our Lord.  This has been true from the foundation of the world.  Pagan practices are then either:  1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection,     in which dim light was shone forth so that people would    recognize the full truth when it was manifested, OR  2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not    recognize the truth when it was manifested.  I dont believe the second argument, because I believe in the power of the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope. Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of the truth of the Resurrection.  As Paul states, we see through a glass darkly.  So do others.  It serves no purpose arguing about who has the darker or lighter glass.  The foreshadowings are not perfect. So what? Our understnding of God is today imperfect, for we are not yet perfected.

'I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available.

'GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.   (Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning - Note: Ive set all followups to sci.med since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and Im sure most of the replies, if any, will be med-related.)     They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS). Oops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and Ill send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NTs comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I dont know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.ers?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  Ive known many M.D.s of this temperament and suffice to say I dont oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctors.  :^)  Enough on this subject - lets move on to candida bloom.    Youve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis, but being the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts.  Lets all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (wont get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENTs made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered systemic in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (hes one of those evil orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaines doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  Im even reevaluating some supplements Im taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.    Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that demonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, cant remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950s which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  Ill have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the bodys allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and Ill repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesnt cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  Hes also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of ifs, and implies, which doesnt please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or its a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you cant observe or culture the yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then theres no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  Its a real Catch-22.  Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if its not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, Im very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  Im afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practices case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds its a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...    Arent there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?    Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae ("roots") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you cant kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor Ive been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  Its like trying to weed a garden by cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.    Also, if one is an anal retentive, like Ive been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)    As Ive said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies dont work. For example, I went to three ENTs, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the abs failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia werent plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENTs I saw who said that Id just have to "live with it".  Im confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of abs for the last four years.  (Note:  for those having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENTs totally floored him when they said "youll just have to live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  Im sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- "yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, "its worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical yeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldnt you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldnt work.  Im afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we dont see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I went to a couple of doctors who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  Id like to hear a doctor tell me: "well, Ive tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly dont work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I cant promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and Ill have to register your case at the State Board."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I wouldve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that its doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).  I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.    What dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes?    Id like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.    Brave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual desensitization.  I now kind of like being called "anal retentive" - it has a nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...    Thanks again for a great and informative post.

'A new alternative to Scouting for those "unacceptable to BSA" for reasons of religious or sexual preference:   From: "BOYD R. CRITZ, III" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  "Birth Announcement" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe                        Information Service ===================================================================                        FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                      -------------------                                        (SM)                         EnviroLeague   A new youth movement,"EnviroLeague," was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three "Program Divisions" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of "EnviroLeague Teams," either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the "draft" portions of the Mentors Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeagues founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServes Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named "EnviroLeague." ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeagues Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:        EnviroLeague        P.O. Box 418        Peoria, IL  61651-0418   Those interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish contact, to receive a diskette (IBM DOS, ASCII) with initial information. --';0

'I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities quite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...  Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.  Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there (no, I dont usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible? Is there something else that I could do?

'Were the early Christians weird?  Yes!  So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, its so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it wont help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Browns book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I dont suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Browns other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Foxs _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucaults books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)  Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him. Fortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.  Easter, 1993.  (yes; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forward because so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils, and the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do it here and there as well.  Think of this as an Anglican fad.  :-))';3

'Despite my trendy, liberal, feminist tendencies and the fact that I basically agree with what you are saying I will rebut:    The basic question here is "how do I know what I am supposed to do?" This is true in every situation that comes up. Some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses. I claim that is just as dangerous as "following authority". I could site sexually transmitted diseases, drug abuse, all manner of criminal activity, the savings and loan scandal, car accidents, eggs thrown at my house, all are examples of people not "following authority". I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the  problem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what  he wanted. Of course, where is the top of the chain? Therein lies  our search.    I dont think its as simple as you are claiming. "Pressing need" is ambiguous. Should I recycle or not?    Realize that I have four kids who, despite being very precocious  of course, are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them.   Ahh! An ironic ending.   The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper  sticker cliche "Question Authority" was that I was questioning  the authority of the person telling me to question authority. It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different, only in rebelling, forsaking everything for the sake of freedom. I question their integrity and fortitude.  There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly. Different people are at different levels of development in different areas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow, we cant know everything about everything. Often  when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher, perhaps blindly. Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should I question him, only when I have developed my skills enough should I challenge him. Once again, how do I know when I get to those stages?  If you have to be told to question authority, perhaps you shouldnt.';3
'i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too.  as far as i could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the bible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament. in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of satan as a (excuse the pun) "devils advocate" for yahweh.  see the book of job.  getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_ references to "lucifer" in the bible except for a mistranslation of "the morning star" in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as "the sun king" referred to louis xiv.    all in all, i dont know where the story _came from_; it may have been rolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have invented it.  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am in a hurry and need to eat lunch!  feel free to email me about the other stuff i found out....

'Oh yea?  Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  And why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is God trying to confuse us?   But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of  denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding from varying translations of biblical texts by "serious students" that are much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible, then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be no need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe the Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to read it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us something we cannot use correctly.   IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book, you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE the Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language, all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation of the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.

Theres no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.

'I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellogs Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellogs frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.  Thanks.';2
'Um, I hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site. They have no meaning on other machines.   You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests which show no such "chinese restaurant effect" unique to MSG (its elicited by the placebo as well.)   Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, its undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrigs disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I dont know about premier, but its certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but theyre not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.

'Responding to the moderator:   Yes, I agree.  What Im trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I dont think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu';3

'Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries too, are all measures of size.  In this case Id say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area.   Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.   Western news in general, but in particular the American "mass media": CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of "those poor, poor Iraqis" along with "look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits".   I agree.   Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But thats easy to say from our "enlightened" viewpoint here in the 90s, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of  thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and  millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and  other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All  things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, dont regret it.   Sure.  And its the people who suffer because of them.  All the more reason to depose these "entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests"!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well??   I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the worlds oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.   Well, its not very "loving" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, Id have to say yes, stopping Hussein was the most "loving" thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.  I mentioned it.  If we hadnt intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia.   Sure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a "Thousand Year Reich".  The consequences stemmed from that.  What should I say about them?  Anything in particular?    So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black officers involved, Im sure their would have been black jurors too. This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.   So?  Its "hard to imagine"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of "Constructing a Logical Argument"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)   I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals.     OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved. And frankly, the original "not guilty" verdict baffled me too.  But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, its evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were "not guilty".  Note,  not "not guilty" of doing wrong, but "not guilty" of aggravated assault  with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.  If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then I feel the "not guilty" verdict was a reasonable one.   Thanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.  (Im a  Monty Python fan, you know.  Kind of seems in that vein.)  Of course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory.  But then, you know that already.    Regards,';0

'True to a point.  If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist...    Actually, yes and no, Hell is eternal death.

If I      supposedly can feel these flames, I would assume Im still      alive, but suffering and away from God.

'I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with "Kartageners syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. "Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they cant find the patients heart sounds (because theyre on the wrong side).   According to Harrisons, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion.

'Firstly, I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that Im a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  "Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness." For all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a "non-believer", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.';3

It may be impossible to know much about Toricellis thoughts; thats too bad if it is so.

'[FAQ and Darius response deleted]    I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.   I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of "[esteeming]  all days alike" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of Gods  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate Gods goodness and grace.

Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.

'Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine "Morning Star".  Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.      The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on	the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist.	Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her fathers     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the	rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until  				   -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Marias life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,	Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Gorettis, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)	twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandros     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria	lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  "get  a     handkerchief,"  as	he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldnt go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. "No, No, No! Do  not	touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Marias chest, who was now on the floor.      "Will you or will you not?" Maria gathered all her energy.	"No I     will  not,	Alessandro,  no!"   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Marias  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   "He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not."      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro	away.     As	the  ambulance	carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion  				   -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  "Yes.  For the     love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me     in	Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have." Maria     died at about three oclock.      Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Marias  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging Gods par-     don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony     in	Marias  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,     on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the     first mother ever to be present at her daughters canonisation.      May St. Maria Goretti help	us  to	be  pure  and  grant  us  the     strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.       by Brendan Arthur';3

'Concerning Christians praying for coporate forgiveness of national sins,  Michael Covington claims the following of C.S.

I have read the  same essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim.  Rather, Lewis is  condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make  political jabs at opponents, feigned as confessions of guilt (ie., Lord please  forgive us for allowing "insert political issue/idea/platform" to exist in our country, it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness.).

'The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the  question under discussion is not truth but arrogance.   A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood  transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are  Jehovahs Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood  transfusion. The doctors efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood  transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as  Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.  The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary  to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the  doctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his  beliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance.';3

'davem@bnr.ca (Dave Mielke) writes,       I am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it.  Gods love  is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of  rejecting Gods love but He never fails to love us.  These verses do not show that Gods love is qualified but rather that He  is opposed to evil.  I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be  an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship  because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into  accepting Christ.    I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows Gods love with  putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel  without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a  clanging cymbal.  Heres a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are  afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to Gods love?';3

'Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since youre forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the bodys detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  Thats because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isnt metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic.';2

'[DISCLAIMER: Throughout this post, there are statements and questions which could easily be interpreted as being sarcastic.  They are not.  I have written this reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boiling to the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no one, except myself ;-)]    [...]   	Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced 	mental facilities which have not developed "religion" as a 	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?  	Further, it appears that only humans have a "need" to explain the 	unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet, 	including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly 	content in their ignorance.  	Id like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me 	from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal 	*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need 	not be researched; 3) religion was "made up" by humans to address a 	perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that 	is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical 	structure with biology at the apex).  	Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the 	underlying presuppositions.   	I disagree that Christianity is "an infectious cult".  It has 	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in 	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia. 	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is 	"infectious" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides 	a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this 	is the case).  	I disagree that Christianity is "a safety blanket" which supplants 	hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one 	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a 	Christians source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to 	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose 	and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of 	control over ones own life the problem or is it something else?  	Finally, one does not appropriate "eternal happiness" by following 	Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance 	of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people 	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the 	Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian 	in the Person of Gods Spirit.  	Heaven is one of two final states that 	Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally 	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this 	promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived 	benefits to them in the here-and-now.   	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a 	priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this 	as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate 	priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word, 	convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum). 	Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting 	the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits 	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful 	that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask 	"Why?"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom- 	plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it 	does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian 	is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of 	friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot 	evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or 	harm others if the sole purpose of being a "friend" is to gain a 	conversion).  	As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep- 	ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a "hurry-up" 	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no 	conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was 	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open 	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now). 	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings 	conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part 	(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.   	We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die 	just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more 	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is 	so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find 	a more expansive view.  	(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing 	arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language 	of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so? 	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social 	structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)   	Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive. 	Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not 	a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship 	with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close- 	knit relationship with this appelation.   	There are "Jesus freaks" who let the emotional aspects of worship 	and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so, 	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these 	things flow.   	Guilty by association?  That "christianity" which forces itself 	upon another is not Christianity at all.   	You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened 	2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?  	I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus influence was a sole 	result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years 	gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert 	that nothing about Jesus life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.   	Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself. 	What do you know of Him?';3

'I havent followed whatever discussion there may have been on these people, but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and I see no reason for embarrassment.  If you think that errors and flawed arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant; any philosophy course will introduce you to their weaknesses.       The above also expresses a rather odd sense  I said nothing about "the masses."  However comparing "the masses" in our day and in Aquinas day really *is* odd.  Read Ortega y Gasset on this.  Im talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and winning on logic and evidence, only to discover your opponent to be unaware, even intuitively, of things like entailment (let alone pragmatics).

'...  I think this is a big leap sex->depression.  One example is myself, where no sex->depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline, depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say  depression->promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and promiscuity is used as an escape. Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond, I dont see a problem with sex before (not outside of) marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just  my opinion.';0

'Good point -- it is very true that these "false" predictions are dangerous--we are warned (more than once) in scripture about false prophtets.  	However, as is often the case with other issues, one cannot let those who falsly report such "visions" as a reason against believing in any of them (I did not get the impression you were asserting this, by the way...I consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole).  	Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.  	Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism 	(something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik 	revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte	predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who 	was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)  	She warned there would be "fire in the sky" as a warning that the  	second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany 	invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from 	England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular 	reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to  	explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Marys 	prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.  	Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all 	over the world and persecute religion.    	She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every 	single one has been realized.  	One can only use the term "coincidence" 	so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes  	ridiculous.    	SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There 	are true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was 	one example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the  	apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia 	(or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day for 	eleven years now.  Its time the world started listening.';3

'note: i am not the original poster, i am just answering because i think this is important.  [evil result of human sinfulness, rather than the will of God]  whoo.  im going to have to be very careful with my language here.  i think God is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so that we can decide on our own where we go -- free will.  in this sense God allows evil to occur, and in this sense can be "held responsible" as my chaplain says.  however, his will is, of course, that all be saved.  hes not going to save us "by himself" -- we have to take a step in his direction before he will save us.  read that last sentence carefully -- im not saying we save ourselves.  im saying we have to ACCEPT our salvation.  i do not believe in predestination -- it would appear from what you say further down that you do.

[yet more deleted]  yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement.  as for now, evil can be done by human beings that is NOT Gods will -- and the best we can do is see taht some good comes out of it somehow.  the thing that most worries me about the "it is the will of God" argument is that this will convince people that we should not STOP the rape and killing when i think that it is most christ-like to do just that.  if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a good parallel, but im going to go with it anyway), why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more innocent?';3
'Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council.   New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak  To: National Desk, Environment Writer  Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both           of the Natural Resources Defense Council     WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.    The EPA list is attached.    "These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration," said Erik Olson, a senior attorney with NRDC.  "Water contamination isnt just a problem in Bangladesh, its also a problem in Bozeman and Boston."    "As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on EPAs list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution," Olson continued.  Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the laws deadline.    Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia.    Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nations system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems.    "This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public," Olson noted.  "The time has come for many of the nations water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink."

'The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds. There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.  I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc. Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism). More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body, the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.  There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind. Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not refute the disciples question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of Christs answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.  There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John the Baptist,     "If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come."  This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ("If you care to accept it").  So I took care to point out, not that the Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I pointedly used "repeated earth lives" to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word "reincarnation". The phrase is Rudolf Steiners (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessings "The Education of the Human Race".  To return to your original point, Pauls statement about Jacob and Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma. And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus Christ, in my view.';3
'Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  I do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930s (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of "cosmic essence." A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet. I should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis.';3

'I find this argument very strange, though not unfamiliar.  An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.  Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group  of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on  the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on  the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?  Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an  arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy. It does not  necessarily mean that they are all arrogant.';3

'ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis)   	II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because  		they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because  		they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)  		parts of the canon.    	then I answer:   		These is a logically invalid *a priori*.   		Besides, we are talking about OT texts-   		which in many parts are superceded by the NT  		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same  		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?  		This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn "Now Thank We All Our God" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the churchs history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends.';3
'John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day) "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was  God."  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God and Jesus are one.  Therefore, "The Lord" refers to both.  Also, David in the Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Once again this refers to God and Jesus.     swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?  Some of the most "truly religious" people Ive known have not been Christians and some of the greatest Christians Ive known have been truly irreligious. However, to answer your question: The bible speaks of this in many places, A previous post to James is a good one.  Another is Psalm 15: "Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?  Who may dwell in your holy hill?  He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart He who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor does he take up a reproach against his friend; I whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to his own hurt and does not change; He who does not put out money at usury, nor does he take a bribe aginst the innocent.

I dont think it is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food. She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.  The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made by Kellogs makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our immediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running nose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history including some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms.   Anyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body chemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures either.  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of relief.  Thanks again.';2

'It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldnt be pushed any further.  Id say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldnt last too long, and doesnt seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonuss at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that arent what they need, Im sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They dont get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We cant design systems that meet just their needs, or we wont sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we dont have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you dont expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  Thats a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!

'The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by the European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers and half a MMU, but otherwise its a 68010. Think of it the same as the 8086 and 80186 were.  		Burkhard Neidecker-Lutz';1
'Dont get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the 68070 its number. The 68070, if I understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has an on-chip serial port and DMA.

'OFM responds to a query about reference works:     [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an    introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary    styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further    reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Youngs NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The "Introduction" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Dulings Intro is also very good.  Its somewhat more modern than Ku:mmels but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harpers Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harpers is "OK" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).     ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...  So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title (James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think I recall a (older) series under the name "Harper Commentaries".  Also theres a separate Harpers Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on the HC also apply to the HBD.)  My favorite one-volume commentary is the "New Jerome Biblical Commentary".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and large excellent.  NOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the "Jerome Biblical Commentary", copies of which can still be found on sale.';3

'This is a good point.  Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the Messiah--in fact, a number of "Messiahs" were active in the area from the time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada.   Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that they didnt realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.  Many of the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining  this new definition of "Messiah" to the Jews who were being preached to.';3
'I dont know which passage you are refering to, but the passage I have often seen cited as an example of a mother image of God is Isaiah 49:15 "Can a woman forget her sucking child / that she should have no  compassion / on the son of her womb? / Even these may forget, /  yet I will not forget you."    This passage is *not* a mother image of God at all. The mother here is the image of the best human constancy can show, and it is  contrasted with the constancy of God.

'Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist outside the uteris.  Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesnt.

'This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1 ping-pong game, and I dont have any strong disagreement, so Ill try to stick to the one thing I dont quite follow about the argument:  It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible was "enlightened for its times" (i.e. closer to what we would consider morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one hand [I hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on the other hand:   }|> }Disclaimer:  Im speaking from the Jewish perspective, }|> }where "the Bible" means what many call the Old Testament, }|> }and where the interpretation is not necessarily the }|> }raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries }|> }and traditions passed down through Jewish communities. }|>  }|> This seems the crux to me: if you judge the Bible according to a long }|> line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day, }|> rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course }|> it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values. } }But if thats how the Bible is actually being used today, }shouldnt that be how we should judge it?  If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldnt Consumers Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  Thats possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was "enlightened for its times". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  Im not arguing that the Bible is "disgusting", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I dont think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I dont know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still dont think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.';0

'Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person cant digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But its important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that "pisses off" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that persons system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And dont think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, lets say, having contracted flu from ones sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guys allergic to.   Anyway, the human bodys not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.';2

When you run this program, you will enter read menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter write menu. the write menu is much like       read menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in read menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in read menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in read menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in read menu will do Slide Show.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in read menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in read menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter screen menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter write2 menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you original filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you selected filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you dont have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

'You assume this because you believe in a designing creator, and you observe our ability to procreate...   .... But then you observe our ability to modify fertility through intelligence & experiment, and draw no similar conclusions about God designing us for scientific inquiry & the use of the technology that it produces.  How is it that one ability is "obviously from God", and the other not?   I want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon. Falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows corrupting both the intellect and the heart.   If there is a God, he has nothing to fear from truth.

'I love the FAQ.         The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?  Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of only about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to 95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not be understanding all of the differences.  In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which glasses couldnt help.   would not help.';2

'A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God:   > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil,  > and unworthy of my worship or faith.  Nobuya "Higgy" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge Gods  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge Gods actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of "good" is "whatever God happens to want." But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you dont. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might "Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: "Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing." That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, "Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?" or even, "Boy, that was a real slip -- hes just thrown the game away!" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Josephs ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: "Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good."           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevitys sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, "And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Josephs brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, "You were talking about the Holocaust, werent you?" He answered, "If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it." I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbis lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact Gods doing -- that He stirred up Josephs brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaohs heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: "How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art." In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Josephs brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fishers knight instead (dont bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not Gods doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted Gods plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, "I will harden Pharaohs heart, so that he will not let the people go"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: "If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me."  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of Gods will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Josephs brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.';3

'If you were omniscient, youd know who exactly did what, and with what purpose in mind.  Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal.   In an objective system, there are known goals.  Then, actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is, the goals of each society are different.  Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.   Ive said it many, many times.   Which part do you have a problem with?   But, we can enslave the animals, right?  But just not kill them?  Or are you a vegetarian for health reasons?   No.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant, anyway.   Of course not.

What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no inherent system.   Nope.  Again, it seems okay to kill other species for food.';0

'Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...  Im the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGIs uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

'-*-----  These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.';2
'That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God Father,  we are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being like a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less misleading of the two possibilities.';3
'What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.  Libertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.';1

'First of all, "ceremonial law" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is "sabbaton" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption "the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because "the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law."  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?';3
'In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed "movies". They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.  I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many  other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I dont know what kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.

'Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin, which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development, especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less sensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu, on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened.';2

'My girlfriend just started taking Imitrex for her migraine headaches.  Her neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound headaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking all analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).  The weekend was pretty bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours.  Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  Skin was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsided in an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to control the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor?  Has anyone else heard of these symptoms?

'As you note, the research is mixed, so there is no consensus on the role of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis.

'Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that Im not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.

Image Format Compatibility  	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.  		    Image Analysis & Processing  	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.  		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis  	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.  		    Easy External Program Interfacing  	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.  		    Quick Quality Presentation  	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinxs 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers. 	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?  		    Software Support & Development  	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire dOptique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National dEtudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.

'Eric ("Damien"?) was presenting his views on Christianity; Ill respond to a few of his points:   This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of- nature.    Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space world didnt have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world, in its Source.    When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one the requires a kind of "faith" too.   By taking such a hard line in your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.  But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope youll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by reading Paul Johnsons "A History of Christianity".  From your remarks, it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and be animated by some enduring values.  With best wishes,';3

'Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin.  (If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)  This implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should never be satisfied. It does not imply that having fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin. It does imply that I sin every day.  A perhaps simpler definition: Anything that is counter to the two Great Commandments:  love God, love your neighbor, is a sin. Anything I do that is not from love is a sin.  The same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.  I could yell at my kids as discipline, all the time loving them, considering only to teach them proper behavior, or I could yell at my kids out of anger or selfishness.

Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule (current standard therapy).

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  Its only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often its a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.

What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isnt often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - its a sort of liars paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldnt object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesnt arise if we dont actively wish to take way anyones freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a "justice" system.

'how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?  What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, "Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy."

'OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (85-89), the PI (88-93), the Professional Series (the early 4Ds - 86-90), the Power Series parallel systems (88-93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we dont, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You cant wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If its feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If thats happening, its becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so dont give up, we know it.  Josh   |:-)  --';1

'Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  A general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases, by establishing links to the "Lyme community", treating patients who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional patients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill $100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his office, and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure, then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out by support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."';2
'Harumph. Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to. :-) 	I cant really argue with your logic, though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease. 	By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.

'Ive been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  Ive been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ and  `Christian.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasnt a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didnt disown me but they didnt completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didnt come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, "As far as Im concerned, you still are a Jew."  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (Ill concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I dont have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I dont like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldnt assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron.';3

But the ancient Romans did not observe a seven-day week.  Unless a man was working for a Jewish employer, he is unlikely to have been paid on the first day of a seven-day week. Nor would a Jewish employer have kept his wages over the week-end (see Lev 19:13; Dt 24:15).';3
'Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but I suspect that a biggie is that the God theyve believed in is (in J.B. Phillipss words) "too small".  If a persons understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop, it will eventually become inadequate.  The grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a comforting image in childhood becomes a joke.  A therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they "fire God".  What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of God to make room for a fuller one.  But she follows up by encouraging them to "hire a new one".  My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing process, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire.';3

'# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply dont agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Quran, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the "evil" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as "satanic."       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing "color" to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you havent already) or THE DRAGONS EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The "unseen" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, its okay to say      "well, Satan is just metaphorical," but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isnt a bar to evil.  Lets      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are "evil."  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

'It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now, there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (x,y)s).  2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you        can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the        Reference(x,y).      b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you cant allow the convex hull to change, and you cant allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.

'How about this description: "An object that is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle"? I hold that no object satisfying this description could exist.

Now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, "That object is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle." This does not mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description was incorrectly applied.    The atheist says, "The descriptions of God that I have been presented with are contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist."  Now, your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists, but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of It.  This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and, when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one, are told that it is a "Euclidean circle-square". Can they be blamed for doubting rather strongly that this bicycle exists at all?    No kidding. :->   Sincerely,   Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu';0

'Ill take a try at this...  From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this, before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked  back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know  Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to  Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.  Leonard    --';3

(I might be a little off on the title, but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity,  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  ->	The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.  ->	Some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesnt mean that it isnt true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that dont think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels werent that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  ->	Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. ->	Therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isnt one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  ->	Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I dont have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldnt be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  ->	I dont think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for Gods  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we cant do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  Thats tuff and most people dont want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We dont rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that dont.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

'Ill pose a question here thats got me thinking:  what distinguishes "true" religion from cults (Im speaking generally here, not specifially about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian "cult" from the Presbyterian "church"?  Doctrinal differences dont answer the question, IMHO, so dont use them as an answer.    -- Scott at Brandeis  	"But God demonstrates His     "The Lord bless you, and keep you; 	 own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you, 	 while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you; 	 Christ died for us."	       the Lord lift up His countenance on you, 				       and give you peace." 		-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]		-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]';3

'John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesnt seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasnt because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.';3

'As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:  	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager  	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a 	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two 	counter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits -- 	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.  	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about  1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |		|  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \^^/   \^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |		|  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|			   |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (Im typing this over an extended period of time), and I  dont have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I dont  pin it up first.  As far as Im concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely Ill use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, Im more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since Ive had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product Ive ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones Ive seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom". Im only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but its the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.';2

'Good point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14).  [stuff deleted]    True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.    	Youre not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men to exlcude them, as I will explain below.  "That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of the New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the Apostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same to the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the Apostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of John." 	-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)  	This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage (397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which council the same list was enumerated with the words "Because we have recieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the Church."  Which ought to quiet those who assert "in the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church," as the Episcopal Church does in removing the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.) 	Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.  "And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the number of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet]....

Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is Maccabees." 	-Origen, "Commentaries on the Psalms," Psalm 1 (245 AD)  "Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows]." 	-St. Clement of Alexandria, "The Instuctor of Children," 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)  "....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ...

'If youre talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation, well, its obviously a risk one takes.   Im not an objectivist, so Im not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization.  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the perspective of whats being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).  An analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is that the "better" descriptive language is not available.   This word "reliable" is essentially meaningless in the context-- unless you can show how reliability can be determined.';0

'I dont claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more  than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephards Rod.  The Shephards Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30s.  The Shephards Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephards Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.';3

Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges people if they follow him (see Acts 17:29-31 and John 5:21-27) and that those who reject Jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke (see John 12:47-50), then Jesus words are true and do not need interpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word if it had to be interpreted.';3
'someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture    needles.....  Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so its good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,  being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                         If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get  their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.       The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly  use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong               patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates  this risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and             nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                         Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all  solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into  meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require  the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be  injected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is  puntured. On the other hand when the solid  acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle  from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that  havent been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain  on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.   Of course in TCM...the bodys exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory  and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture  site.   While Im fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease  transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for  what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.';2
'So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. The more we love God; the more we come to love what and whom He loves.  When I find that what I am doing is not good, it is not a sign to try even harder (Romans 7:14-8:2); it is a sign to seek God. When I am aware  of Jesus presence, I usually want what He wants. It is His strenth, His love  that empowers my weakness.';3

'There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill. Thats the point, after all.   Thats because these "peer-reviewed" studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, theyre looking at animal models. You cant walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldnt have any argument with a statement like "noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans."  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than "food science".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  Im familiar with the literature, and Ive never seen any which relate at all to Olneys work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; its a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.   Goodness, Im not saying that its good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  Its just that this "projected safety margin" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can "prove" anything you like.  Were talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet youre misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean "asserting".  Youre being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because youre conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olneys reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but thats not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)  It says nothing about MSGs contribtion to the phenomenon of the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.   Probably one of the dumber remarks youve made.';2

'. 	. 	.  Why do you assume that Jesuss plea to His Father "to let this cup pass from Him", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesuss attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of Jesuss suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg.  BTW, we know from Johns account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king.  From John:  JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they             began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the             world." JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by             force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.  This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesuss dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew what His Fathers will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion.';3

'No, Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism, not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals.  This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not conducive to a free society.  Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant to future offenders. Mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of rehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you, okay?';0
'The next time you go to church, you can check the better creed, that is, have learned that on the first go around.  But whats a body without  a little bit asoul?    At the risk of offending everybody, I will interject the 13th century point of view.  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham to set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before drawing them with Him back to this earth.  Im no expert on this part, but Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: "tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many."

'Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I dont believe gods exist", or "I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka) pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean.  Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism, at least according to the FAQ:  # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. # Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is # often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong # atheism". #  # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak # atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong # atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".

'Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now its also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that theres nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the childs age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the childs age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenzas impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDCs annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patients uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

'It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated by certain anti-Christians as if Christians have been given a firm command to destroy the earth. You could prove almost anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible - its a big book, you know. I doubt you could find a single case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief.  As for the Nazis, they were motivated by German Nationalism, not by Christianity. In fact they despised Christianity as a weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan glorification of strength and warfare. They killed the Jews because they were not Germans, not because they were "Christ-killers" - they were just as keen on killing the other non-German ethnic minority, the Romanies or Gypsies.';3
'The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the   incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb   through my archives and pull out some of "The Best of Alt.Atheism"   for your reading pleasure.  Ill post a couple of these a day   unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good   material.    I havent been particularly careful in the past about saving   attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,   but someone correct me if Im wrong.  This is probably the longest   of my entire collection.  ________________________________________________________                                     So that the                                   Prophecy be                                    Fulfilled                                       * * *         In considering the Christian religion, and judging it according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthews main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  "[Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him Jesus (which means Gd is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins."  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord Gd said to Isaiah, "go to meet with Ahaz..."         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, "Ask a sign of Gd your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven."  But,        Ahaz said, "I wont ask; I will not put the lord to a        test."  Then (Isaiah) said, "Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        "Immanuel," which means, "Gd is with us."   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word "almah," (young woman), as specifically, "virgin."  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be Gd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesuss birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        "Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son."   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Baals, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hoseas oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists Gd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more."     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are "no more."  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her "children," it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, "on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem)."        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesuss life to enhance the message of the churchs gospel.        Because of the whole storys similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The "children" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  Gd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthews purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the "prophecy" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who "He" is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samsons mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  "...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines."  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of Gd.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases."  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovahs chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by Gd.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a "servant" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthews parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldnt arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            "Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name."  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the "light" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace Gd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of Gd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic "...the coastlands await his law." to the Christologic, "the Gentiles will hope in his name."   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of "believing in the name."  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, "a people robbed and plundered..."   So, we see that when Matthews attempt at "prophecy" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a "day" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didnt forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the "ninth hour," which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, "rose," before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthews little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his gods mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the "plain" message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          "You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        peoples heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them."  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from Gd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And Gd said, "Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed."  Then Isaiah said, "How long,        lord?"  And he said, "Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the Gds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled." The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really Gd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophets warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomons (and Davids) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of Gd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiahs verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didnt understand Jesuss stories.  And, as we see, Isaiahs verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from Gd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthews prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesuss parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, "I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world."  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthews gospel even inserted Isaiahs name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things "known, that our fathers have told us."  Jesus deals with things "hidden since the foundation of the world."  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthews artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthews prophecies arent the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to "dispossess" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didnt have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old womans arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we dont get to see God anymore.         Were too lazy; were not zealous enough; were        sinful; its just his "plan"; we put too many of our        own demands on Gds appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet Gd on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen Gd.  You, dear reader, have not seen Gd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know thats presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that weve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing Gd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see Gd.  Sometimes, they say, "See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing Gd."   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning Gd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing Gd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing Gd the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.  Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt."  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isnt all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthews version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Havent you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little "prophetic" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthews track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, "Havent you read?" for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no "perfect praise" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to Gd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthews pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         "The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet."  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  Its tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesuss time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under Davids rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesuss time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiahs advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVHs utterance to my lord: 	"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool."         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           "You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever."  The word "lord" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is "adoni," and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means "lord," a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to Gd.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either "a psalm of David," or "a psalm about David."  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about Davids covenant and endorsement from Gd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in Davids age.  We have extensive tales of Davids doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when Gd had put his show of favour for Davids kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by Gd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesuss question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in Johns gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesuss career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by Gd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to Johns little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potters Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, "It isnt lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money."  So they... bought a potters field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potters        field, as the lord directed me."  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, "Cast        them to the treasury," --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of Gd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before Gd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, "treasury," had been replaced by the King James Scholars with "to the potter," precisely because this made Matthews quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed "treasury," which also makes perfect sense in Zechariahs context, whereas "potters field" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthews track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judass situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the "prophecy" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthews work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         "They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots."  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, "I thirst."  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished;"  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the "Jesus" in the psalm asks Gd for the damnation of the "crucifiers," whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, the        dont know what they do!"  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesuss drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the "prophecy" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, "What of the casting of lots?"  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesuss clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesuss clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        dont answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like "the lamb led mute before its shearers."  Indeed, Jesus doesnt do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  "He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him."  This seems to fit Jesuss execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and Im sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words "have pierced" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase "like the lion" and a very rare verb form which can mean "pierced" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, "like the lion" (kaari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to "kaaru."   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the "prophecy" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalms true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesnt say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts arent bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesuss life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been "enhanced" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesuss crucifixion.  Johns gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesuss execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        "The will look on him whom theyve pierced."  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  Johns attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthews attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  Johns errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.   Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         "He was reckoned with the transgressors."  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the "prophecy" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how "those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him." [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, "Arent you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!"  This certainly fits with Marks recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, "Save yourself!" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        "Dont you fear Gd, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."         And Jesus answered, "Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise."  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesnt seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Lukes recount also disagrees with Marks.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of Gd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temples        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, "I am the christ."          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, "this generation shall not pass away..." really means "this race of people will not pass away..."  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasnt in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.';0

'I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I dont know if this is believeing blindly or not. Im not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses wont help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of Gods revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.';3
'And that, of course, is the point.   You cant simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someones suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief  in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point.';0

'-- and --   Good grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??  The University of Washington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard, UNC]) has a department and advanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat, and there are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work. People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well.  Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable, reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.    The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors, and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS student in a thesis.';2
'Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4                         Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is raining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of "deny", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a God" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because", "since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesnt seem obvious to you, dont be afraid to question it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, youre right, it is obvious" when youve heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or "therefore".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  "If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God."  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but well come to those later.)  Another example:  "God created you; therefore do your duty to God."  The phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because B".  If were interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If were trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  "There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start." -- This is an argument.  "My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the arguments premises are false.  If the arguments premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for implication.  The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion.  "T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: "... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: "Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witnesss testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponents particular circumstances.  For example: "It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when youre quite happy to wear leather shoes?"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponents argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  "Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  Youre white."  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that ones adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as "poisoning the well".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: "Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."  "Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real."  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  "A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred."  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  "I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please dont find me guilty; Im suffering enough through being an orphan."  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  "Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."  "The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  "Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  "Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation" and "John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  "Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists."  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: "Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere."  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  "I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache."  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  "The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons."  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  "Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office."  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  "We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God."  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  "Have you stopped beating your wife?"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  "Where did you hide the money you stole?"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  "How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?" or "Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  "What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  "We should not speak ILL of our friends" and "We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  "The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight."  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  "A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses."  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  "You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  "Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: "If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and well have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana."  "A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: "Isnt history based upon faith?  If so, then isnt the Bible also a form of history?"  "Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isnt Islam a form of Christianity?"  "Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so arent dogs a form of cat?"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because "thats the way its always been."  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyones attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  "I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."  "Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King."  "Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  "Youre just being randomly abusive." "So?  Youve been abusive too."';0

'.d. .d. I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so its definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Purim, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldnt swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesnt reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Mans history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

'[deleted]   I am glad that I am not an atheist.  It seems tragic that some people  choose a meaningless existence.  How terrible to go on living only  because one fears death more than life.  I feel so sorry for Eric and  yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as  further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity.      As a Christian I am free to be a human person.  I think, love, choose,  and create.  I will live forever with God.  Christ is not a kind of drug.  Drugs are a replacement for Christ.   Those who have an empty spot in the God-shaped hole in their hearts must  do something to ease the pain.  This is why the most effective  substance-abuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples spiritual  needs.  Thank you, Eric for your post.  It has helped me to appreciate how much  God has blessed me.  I hope that you will someday have a more joy-filled  and abundant life.';3
'Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.  	I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.  	Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?  	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.    	As for you, no one can "convert" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.  	May the Lord bring peace to you,';3

'But, the goal need not be a subjective one.  For instance, the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasnt really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than "the law of the jungle."  I dont think that self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely.';0

'Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest topic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty  vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have.  At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.  I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians "Creation Science" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then "interpret" passages to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time.';0

'some deleted   Dear Will,  Ive never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok. I had a few thoughts!:  "Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead" - James 2:17  Faith is both belief and action. If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say Im a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6 v3 says "We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that if we have come to know Him, then well obey His commands cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.  Hope this helps.';3

'Thanks to all who replied to my initial question.  Ive been away in  New Jersey all week and was surprised to see all the responses when I got back.    To the person asking about nicotine patches, there are four on the market:';2
'Hi,  Ive just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few  concerns that maybe yall can help me with.  Ive been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (Im at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits Ive gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands Ive thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though Im at 28 weeks the babys size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the babys size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and Ive had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway thats 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasnt eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the results.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it  wasnt as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But Im still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I cant even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  Im concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  Im not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  shes concerned about fat?  Im not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I cant seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like Im being punished by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since Im trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation Im not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  Im  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and Ill end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  dont find any foods satisfying.  Thanks';2

'excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory   as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you   clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sins   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but   punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John   3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that   through him it might be saved." when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the   fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.   for those who dont have that right, in the view of the bible they stand   olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.   i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to   Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them';3

HIM:	"If there was a heaven, I would." ME:	"But since there isnt a Heaven, youre not going there, are you?" HIM:	"No."    The point is that Heaven is based on faith--if you dont believe in heaven, theres no way youre going to be in it.   Of course, the next step is, "I dont believe in Hell either, so why will I be there?"  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God. Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never see God--so they do, in fact, believe that theyre going to Hell.   Hell doesnt have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because its eternal,  and its a lot worse than Heaven.  Thats the only comparison that matters.';3

'No need to correct it, it stands as it is said.         You miss the point entirely. Things defined by contradictory language do not exist. Though something existing might be meant, conclusions drawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility to find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of the described then.

'On the question, "Does God hear the prayers of sinners?" we need to distinguish.  If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries ago.  But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone who says, "Lord, I want you to do this for me, but dont expect me to change my way of life," that is a different matter. Even here, I would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (just as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). However, if someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might have the responsibility to say, "Remember, if Gods help is real, then so are His commands."';3
'Hello src readers,  Again the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox Churches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion about it a while ago.    Then OFM comments :   With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter :  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St. Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference was clear: "You have nothing to do with the Church."  These political motives became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.  The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called "the nature of the incarnate word", which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two natures "human" and   "divine"  that are   united in   one "without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration" (from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures "did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye" (also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian, independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didnt  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile "semantic" differences between all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  "To the  Coptic Church, faith is more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us."  Throughout this  century,  the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.  [...]  As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably arent.  Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didnt intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition.';3

'Strictly speaking, youre right - we cant repent _for_ somebody else, for what theyve done.  I guess I dont think its out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in "The sins of society" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that were also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot.

'[ -and many others mailed me.  Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not "cease to exist."  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies "separation."  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my "girlfriend" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldnt wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the "pinpricks" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  "The Consciousness of Christ."  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He "grew in knowledge."  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was "led of the Spirit" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe "free thinker" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his "rational doubt" when in fact he was led to it by his "faith".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a "free thinker" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that "sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism."  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term "a"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time youre in a room of skeptics, yell out "Look, your fly is undone!"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first "Highlander" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject Gods annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.';3

If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    its basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.

'-*---- I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in this thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A "carefully designed and controlled study" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled study" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)';2

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRISTS RESURRECTION              1.  Jesuss enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus disciples                 did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                 had risen from the dead.              4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                 produced to refute Jesus assertion that He                 *would indeed* rise from the dead.';3

'Correction: _hard_ atheism is a faith.    Get a grip, man.  The Stalin example was brought up not as an indictment of atheism, but merely as another example of how people will kill others under any name thats fit for the occasion.    So hard atheism has nothing to prove?  Then how does it justify that God does not exist?  I know, theres the FAQ, etc.  But guess what -- if those justifications were so compelling why arent people flocking to _hard_ atheism?  Theyre not, and they wont.  I for one will discourage people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable statements on hard atheism.  Second, what makes you think Im defending any given religion?  Im merely recognizing hard atheism for what it is, a faith.  And yes, by "we" I am referring to every reader of the post.  Where is the evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon?           ^^^^  Bzzt!  By virtue of your innocent little pronoun, "they", youve just issued a blanket statement.  At least I will apologize by qualifying my original statement with "hard atheist" in place of atheist.  Would you call John the Baptist arrogant, who boasted of one greater than he?  Thats what many Christians do today.  How is that _in itself_ arrogant? With your sophisticated put-down of "they", the theists, _your_ serious misinformation shines through.  -- Bake Timmons, III';0
'But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will NEVER lead anywhere.  Im sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by follow-on rigorous clinical trials.    Good point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to "circle the wagons" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless (maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence to support controversial subjects, such as the "yeast hypothesis").  But evidence is evidence - it requires a "jury" or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not worthless.  Rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.';2

'The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isnt an immoral person. It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his fathers love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his fathers son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. We are willing to be saved by grace, but once we are Christians we want to go back to earning and deserving.  "Are you so foolish?

'Hi.  Im writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program Ive written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  Ive used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I dont know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesnt handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...  Thanks in advance for any help,';1
'For a brief, but pretty detailed account, try Hempels _Philosophy of Natural Science_.   This smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that Toricellis subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  It gets dangerously close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions of their "real" reasons.   But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that "ridiculous reasons" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.';2
'Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edges UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for "two-call"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.   If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call 713-279-1066.     --  Jaclyn Brandt jbrandt@NeoSoft.com';1

'If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think you will find that "arrogance" has to do with an offensive exhibition of presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Websters). Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it. Just as a person can be a "humble," authority-questioning, defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and how you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians has been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the behalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.  - Phil -';3

'But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds."      Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.';3
': It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abrahams ``biography in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil Gods promise on Gods behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didnt evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed Gods promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit. (Titus 3.5)  Amazing Grace! Hallelujah!';3

'There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic.  Its use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where its an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  Its disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But Ill buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.';3

'[deletions] [deletions]   As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity. However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner. It is usually presented more in the form, "And *besides*, I cannot see... ...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation."  Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not an argument in theisms favor. Especially when different theisms offer  different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly the same theism give different explanations...    Not im my experience.

Charley,  I cant help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you dont answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, Ill present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you werent referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel dont fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that "senses and reason are all we have to go by", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the "axioms" of reason that one couldnt help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you dont retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of "included text" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldnt respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid "included text"?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...

'Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person. The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago (as were all of the "holy" books). Follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heavens (!) sake dont take it literally.  				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  	So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist? The Buddhas commandments are 500 yrs older than Christs and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christs "we are all sinners").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to "awaken" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out ("woman was created after man, to be his helper" etc). aras  	   	When ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and other brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an 1-800 number to turn in your pledges.

'The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldnt be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. Its sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesnt. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who dont go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us.';3

'Theres a lot of evidence, it just hasnt been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used.  For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF theyve been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  Hes kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  Im also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since thats the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so theres no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  Youll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection, I cannot guarantee their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.';2

The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.

'Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain  things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?  These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to "tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of "paradise" when he "heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by "babes" were  "forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment ("the ritual"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.

In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.

'[stuff deleted for brevity]   Your very starting point is wrong.  Christianity is not based on following a moral standard.  "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...

'Really>`?   No, gravity is an inherent system.  You dont need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someones guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered "immoral" under the previous "definitions" of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).';0

'We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (Im the one who cant fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway, turning the thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch hour.  Im out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.) I took cafergot, but it didnt help and the pain started although it wasnt as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided.  This isnt the first time that Ive had a migraine occur after exercise. Im wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?). Im not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into  shape and dont play at high noon) to prevent this?  Thanks,';2

'------------------------------------- 	+ ............The OTIS Project 93  +       	+ "The Operative Term Is STIMULATE" +  	------------------------------------- 	---this file last updated..4-21-93---   WHAT IS OTIS?  OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps theyll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but theyll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesnt interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of its stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when youve got the gumption... thats what theyre here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.      	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site 		 	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite  	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely "anonymous FTP" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Dont forget to get busy and use the "bin" command to make sure youre in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... 	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines 	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you cant find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, well be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where its finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and well arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you cant...we can convert from most formats...wed just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you dont have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, were at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  Its the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this "info-file" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the ".rm" file for     the image or series of images...or in the "Artists" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isnt explicitly given, then youll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and Ill get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, its always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in "dos" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:   	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case theyd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information youd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  Thats about it for now.  More "guidelines" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS    	     (a sumerian deity) or its followers, be they pope, priest, 	     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations 	     however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original   	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.   	     Its possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone 	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.       	     Unless youve given permission for that, its illegal.  OTIS 	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights 	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to  	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed  	     electronically.  If you dont want your images distributed      	     all-over, dont upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is 	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or 	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not  	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,         	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific 	     permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is "stimulate".

'Ill take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable.  I base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition), almost all would want to complain.  Therefore I take it that to assert or believe that "Freedom is not very valuable", when almost everyone can see that it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert "it is not raining" on a rainy day.

'How about:  	The Holocaust 	The Spanish Inquisition 	Jonestown  (just to name a few) ?  Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.

When your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask questions.  Except for situations of pressing need ("I said shut the hatch because the submarine is filling with water!"), any reasonable authority should be able to give at least some justification that you can understand.  Just be sure to listen when authority answers.  (If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and  following orders, you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe  in 1951 on conformity, and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on  obedience.  Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  The  results are both fascinating and terrifying.)';3
'INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.

'[deletia- and so on]  I seem to have been rather unclear.  What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining "spritual needs" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that "fulfilling spiritual needs" means "acknowledging a "higher power" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable.

'[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank ODwyer)]         From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:   "Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For instance, No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as 5 + 7 = 12 remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  One ought always to do the right thing is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of self-evident truths, but can he deny the subjectivists claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity."';0

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider "flavored" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt wont work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book "Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other peoples fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria "Acidophilus" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF "A.I.D.S."            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for "Lyme disease".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "Major" or            "Minor Periods" as listed in the "Solunar Tables" published            bimonthly in "Field & Stream" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 "A.I.D.S.", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book "Life Extension", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to ones subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

'I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia presentations.  It runs graphics and animation as well as some near full motion video very well.  The only thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors.  Its qualit in between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly compromise speed.  It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software, but Im not so sure about the excelerator part.  I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than that.  One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from ROM at startup, (I think) because I have never had to load it for links386 or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at startup.     gromi a16pd                                          HINTMATT@BA.BA.ISU.EDU';1

No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the country, you dont need to be known as an LD "specialist" to see a large number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year, he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not the only orthopedists in the town.  Lets say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD patient.  He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to the knees).  Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.  -Marc. --  --';2

'This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals: --------------------------------------------------- First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.  Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the faces orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.  (Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If youre not... sorry, I cant give out the source, and even if I could it relies heavily on Inventor).';1

'Sorry.   Wrong.    This is how banks got started in the first place. Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they havnt been managing risk very well.   Then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry.    And since they dont all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money, some of them will specialise in that.  Then theyll reinvent interest, but like good Muslims, theyll call it something else.   Riiiight.

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the "Introduction to Atheism"; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isnt covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting ones   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup dont  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_Gods_will,_and_actually_fulfill_Gods_will,_and_    not_let_Gods_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For Gods will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lords creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  Its also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly cant conclude that hes an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isnt to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascals Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you dont believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascals Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Ys version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose youre believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for ones eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in ones interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no "cost".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascals wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occams Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occams Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occams  Razor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occams Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occams Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why its good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think youre cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]".  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einsteins refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einsteins religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: "I believe in Spinozas God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings."  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task..."     "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it."  The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it."  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether its money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you dont think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it cant have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just "is" (or "was").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book "A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldnt assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephuss work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity. It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godels Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godels Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godels First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid (true or false) within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar  Paradox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This  sentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godels Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godels Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldnt tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godels Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"   GB: "I guess Im pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me."   RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?"   GB: "No, I dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God."   RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?"   GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  Im just not       very high on atheists."  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle 88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God" (Bushs phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"    EM: "Its bullshit."    RS: "What is bullshit?"    EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."    RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue."   EM: "Youre welcome."  After Bushs election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government."

Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheists handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldnt the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not."       - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785    "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose."        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it."        - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans "Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, its hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation.';0

A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears dont clear.  If you dont have big pressure changes, you may not know that youve got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.

'I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.  Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation:                                 DMPEG V1.0                         Public Domain MPEG decoder                             by Stefan Eckart   0. Features ===========  DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:    - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard    (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)   - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display   - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)   - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale   - color-space selection   - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required   - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)   - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for    VGA and many Super-VGAs  ...  4. Technical information ========================  The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesnt it?), which turned out to be faster than a fast algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).  Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.  Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas.  ...';1

'LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only if you think it of general interest.  Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may find it relevant.  A listmember asks:   > What makes common-law marriages wrong?  A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is nothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by a preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings.  There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the West) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage, and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.  HOWEVER!  The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife, forsaking all others, till death do them part.        The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be clear about whether a commitment has been made.  Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows, etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live together.       After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it was great while it lasted, but I think its time to move on. younger. ocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours, utterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble breath will utter your name. My..." man is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that. You mustnt take them literally.  And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record.       The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other things) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom, if anybody, and vice versa.       The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with property rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom.       Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they dont want their daughters seduced and abandoned.       Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment, or just "poetry."       And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.        Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when Christians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that the probate judges interpretation of them is not at all what you intended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether "You are my main squeeze" and "I am here for the long haul" do in fact cover the same territory as "forsaking all others" and "till death do us part."        This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic that hasnt?) One listmember was asking, "If a couple love each other and are living together, isnt that marriage in the eyes of God?" Eventually someone asked, "In that case, what is their status if they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce? Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk of that!" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says, "We dont need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other," is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother.  At this point someone may say, "None of this applies to me and my mate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment, for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death us do part. So in our case, no ceremony is needed."      To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a drivers license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence of dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.  Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks: At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I answer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for better or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted such an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?';3

'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isnt in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its "current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesnt check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its "fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads arent performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEGs (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I cant remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing?';1

': [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]   : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this laymans mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the "There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isnt. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt ones very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt ones existence. A being that does exist can doubt ones existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question "why anything exists" can be countered by demanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that dont exist dont exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isnt : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (Ive never been much of a prophet, though. I : cant even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I dont believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You dont mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.   Petri';3

'He doesnt contradict himself.  The church is to last for all time. However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the "super-apostles" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the "praying of Jesus into your life for salvation".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.

'Darren> In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find Darren> arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess Darren> absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines.  and  Darren> In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources Darren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own Darren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend Gods revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For "the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to Gods law, *nor can it do so*"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation ("Sola Scriptura"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, "But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless." (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist.  Ive seen him  described as a `take no prisoners theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that "I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead" but rather "I know that my redeemer lives!"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying "What is truth?" but rather follows Christ, who said, "In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, "If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us "Buy the truth, and do not sell it." (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed "Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in Gods promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of Gods own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once Gods revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably  :-)  and less `academically than you would.  Darren> For example, lets suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, "This is my body."  Darren> Well presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didnt say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lords supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, "This is my body," then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Pauls words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, "For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lords death until he comes."  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lords Supper really is bread (as well as the Lords body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lords body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] Ive been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lords Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching "real presence" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, "Id like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for  yourself whether to believe it or not."  Darren> `REXLEX suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Darren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.

Darren> If someone is interested in my opinion, Id suggest _On Darren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

'Hi Noel,  Ive made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts, triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic 3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.

'I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read?  Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian "scientists" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have "died for a lie".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the "real thing".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I dont think his arguments warrant the use of a "Therefore..."   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tonys argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say "a is equal to b because a is equal to b".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.

Atheists dont believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think its safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it.

'We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on   Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent   Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to   encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Sterns daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundations mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundations booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:';2
'jubilee, Pope >Leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image on one side and on >the other side, the Church of Rome symbolized as a "Woman, holding in >her left hand a cross, and in her right a cup with legend around her, >Sedet super universum,  The whole world is her seat."  	You read more into the medal than it is worth.  The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church "Holy Mother Church" and our "Mother."  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, "Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?" 	Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that "This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many." (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, "From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts."  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote "For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lords death until he comes."

'Purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo" clubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. "Real" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. Im limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "true" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.';2

Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming"   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis"   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

'Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.  [Im not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably havent seen it.  --clh]  Christ warns that anyone who "breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that "where no law is, there is no transgression."  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised "what ever He says to do we will do."  That is why the new covenant is based on "better promises" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to "put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for Gods people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough "For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says "if ye be Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise."  All Christians are Abrahams seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.   People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying "I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 "Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law."  "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom. 7:12).   Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate "lay by him in store" with "go to a worship service."  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate Gods name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [Its not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Pauls comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who "esteem all days alike" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However Id like to be clear that I do not think theres unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says "and they gathered every Sunday for worship".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesnt tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesnt say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But thats just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Pauls collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I cant disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that "on the first day of every week" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.';3
'I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didnt find him judgemental.  I think that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they were trying to say that headbangers would like the program.  But I would NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc.  it is condescending.  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him.  By the way, Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.  Personally, Im a headbanger at times too, but I have a hard time with what most of the secular metal groups promote.  Free sex and drugs (my opinion that many promote these) arent my thing.  I HAVE found several good Christian metal groups that I like.

'perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his continual discussions of this topic -- surely he doesnt feel you should be _pressured_ into something you feel uncomfortable about (since christianity should be a choice one should make on ones own). please also realize that he is doing this out of friendship -- he probably feels you are missing out on something great, and wants to tell you about it.  but since you know where you can learn about christianity, you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that choice, and if the choice is no, you should be respected for that. personally i believe that a christians mission is just to be christ-like, showing his/her own faith and happiness in that faith, and make sure people know they are welcome to talk to you about it.  i do not believe in imposing your beliefs upon others -- but then again everyones definitions of "imposing" may differ.';3
'This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous is going around, I either dont get it at all or get a very mild case. When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.  This was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!  I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us, so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I dont think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, dont forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that around.';2

And, Ill note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- Id say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)   *  In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what I meant by "There is no way out of the loop".  I wrote that human brains "are infested with sin", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, Ill grant, but its not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true and `infallible.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think its unlikely that Im misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, Ive tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I havent, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I havent attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that Im fallible and so theres some chance Im wrong.  Dont get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, its not my fault -- Im just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  Its one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But its not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.';3
'Hi Steve,  As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unixs are the same, you know! As far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)  Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible.  The main problem is that I dont have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it.  As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didnt read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if youre in there on your own, then youre not going to see anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you dont see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!  One final word - if youre not interested, dont bother with it. If you are interested, then please remember that Im not asking for any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism, maybe that will get results??';1
'Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesnt mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isnt.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesnt mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   Im not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.';3
'Of course, if youre planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring ones leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to ones other plans.   In Rushdies case, the one under discussion, one can. It is tragic that in _some_ "Islamic" countries this is so. There are, however, Islamic countries (whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is to be incorporated), e.g. Kuwait, where one can freely make such statements without fear.    This story has become tiresome. The conditions are clear. If you care to make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of _TSV_. If he did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal feelings.';0

'[why are atheists atheists/ believes it could be the result of "brokenness"]   i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who dont share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope to get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.   well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort of "anti-belief" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that sense of "difference", however, when they are associated with "those weird televangelists who always talk about satan".  if youll excuse the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.   you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become stronger in my faith.  if my faith cant support knowing the answers to those questions, it is weak and untrue.    in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you "chose" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your choice, but born of necessity?  [please, no flames about whether or not gay people "choose" their lifestyle -- thats elsewhere in this newsgroup]   im not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain?  [moderator points out that many/ most atheists arent "hostile", they just cease believiing in xiantiy/ religion]   ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an open heart -- including people of "our own camp" with whom we completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith, nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want to know about either the happiness or the religion, ill share what i know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity, not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....   vera noyes';3

'The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they dont actually believe or practice. Ive known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I dont know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) arent directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doenst.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants dont actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as "Word of God", "inerrant", "infallibale", "The Manufacturers Handbook", "The only rule of faith and practice in the church today" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speakers words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks "Where are you?" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered Gods words he would have said something like "Im here in this tree." The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---';3
'I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific  brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them.

'-*---- I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous   Unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific.     Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are "mainly about."  The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.   I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about "absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)   I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds.    This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generations Rhine.   I think this is absurd.     I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases ones defense.)  Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little about either and so have nothing to offer.';2
'Yes, but typically they *dont*.  Not every wild flight of fancy serves (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a "non-rational" process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?  Of course we cant hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasnt the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning "extra-scientific"? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perices notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination, is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?';2

'Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe, to treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases-- a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that hed had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously, I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering.  I have no idea how hes doing hemorrhoid-wise these days. The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.  This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so theres little risk of trying it, but I wouldnt expect much of a result.';2
'As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesuss disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges dont always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldnt be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.';3

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesnt think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.   If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging Infectious  Diseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).   References  1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (range: 0-74 years). Idaho       Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.       Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agricultures Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDCs 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

'Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (havent seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and theres no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesnt seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Pauls letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isnt about homosexuality -- its about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So its not what Id call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately its not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as "wanton", and that another may be specifically "male prostitute".  Again, we dont have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OTs negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however its probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that "strange flesh" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that peoples conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Pauls letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that theres no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But its clear to me that thats mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon ones reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as ones perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...';3

'This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this  doctrine:                           THE DOCTRINE OF GOD   I.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD      Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most      important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.       Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should      be to know God.      I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three      Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the      Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I      believe that they are individual Persons who are one in      nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each      possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also      equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.      Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.  II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  Gods nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for          Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and          unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without          ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.      B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.      C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.          As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,          patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;          Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.      D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely          without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of          sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.          6:3.      E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time          in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all          knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,          infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with          unlimited power over all creation).          God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It          is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day          has become very man-centered, and that the people in our          churches know very little about God.  I believe that the          Lords work needs to be God-centered, and that the          people of God need to understand that God is sovereign          in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives          of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes          regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  In creation           All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in           creating, and all Three are active in sustaining           creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs           (for nations as well as individual people) to the end           of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;           Heb. 1:3.      B.  In salvation          In order to understand salvation I believe that it is          absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.           All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,          active in salvation.          1.  God, the Father              Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the              Godhead determined in eternity past that there would              be salvation, the conditions under which people              could and would be saved, and even who would be              saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in              Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph              1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.          2.  Christ, the Son of God              The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the              virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two              important works:              a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                   God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.              b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                   Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                   the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                   His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                   work of salvation will be completed for us when                   the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-                   4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.          3.  The Holy Spirit              As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is              Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is              carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the              following ways:              a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11              b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                   birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.              c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                   of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.              d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making                    salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.              e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of                   Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13              f.   He teaches every believer the truth of                   Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.              g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of                    God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12              h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.              i.   He empowers for living and for service.                     Cf. Acts 1:8';3

'Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing Gods work in Bosnia.  Ive refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we dont kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldnt see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldnt have doctors or hospitals because illness is Gods judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesnt justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack Gods people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out Gods plan didnt excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldnt conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesnt justify it, and it wont save the people who are doing it from judgement.';3

'Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you dont accept their teachings then you wont be "saved". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when its based upon your interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs cant both be correct. Its all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it Gods truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I dont believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and its up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesnt mean one is wrong and the other is right. As an example, take the question, "Is the glass half empty or half full"? You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be true, does not require everyone elses belief to be wrong.';3

I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict. until I was 23.  Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con  religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist.   This is a very loose explanation, but its the gist of it.  Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally  stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense  of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I  believe in human rights and live and let live among other things. I am very  anti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved.) Religion has no place in my system. Tough.  Bertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesnt exist, we cant prove  it. So, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. But, for all practical purposes there is no god.';3

'So true.  Im not sure of the basis of the belief, but it was a widely held belief among the laity of the RC church and their support of it lead to it being declared to be true.

The pope gets most of the attention/criticism but the consensus of the other bodies is equally infallible (according to RC teaching).';3

'[deleted] think: [deleted]                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Let me first say that "to believe that no gods exist" is in fact  different than "not believing in a god or gods".   I will argue that your latter statement, "I believe that no gods exist" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that "no gods exist" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I dont   know and therefore dont believe in them and dont NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to "faith" and "existence". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel its rather pointless to debate the so called "existence" of God - and that is not what Im doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that "god does not exist", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase "the existence of God" in its usual sense - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by "the existence of God".   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to ones promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion "based upon observation", I will have to ask "what observtions are you refering to?" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents "believe in God" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the "existence" or "non-existence" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say "I believe that God   does/does not exist". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the "existence" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use "Him" because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use "She" go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further Ill be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - its in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks Ive misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. Im interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.';0

'<. . ..  : The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites : take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except : for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about : Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that : the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldnt be so troubled about the reports of "ethnic cleansing" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldnt be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : Gods work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I dont see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. --';3

'(Deletion)   For me, it is a "I believe no gods exist" and a "I dont believe gods exist".   In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when "A exist" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, "A exists" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one cant disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)';0

I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact.

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  "Galactic Pot-Healer" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  "A Maze of Death" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  "VALIS" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  "The Divine Invasion" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  "The Handmaids Tale" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it "right" again.  The book is the diary of a womans life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Womens right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwoods writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  "The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of Theism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackies "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised edition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  "The Miracle of Theism", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for God" such as Lelies axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martins works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

'Regarding David Wilkersons prophecies.  While Im not real sure of his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.

'Hi all, I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color Graphical BBS that supports PC, Mac, Linux, and Amiga callers.  Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of  which hit this group about 2 weeks ago).  Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldnt)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesnt work under System 7 But I cant seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.  Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?  I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.  Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ? I cant seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing.  Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?';1

': I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged : couple become "married" in Gods eyes?  Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in Gods sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I dont mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I dont mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although Im ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)';3

'I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and "rationality" in science.  Since Ive addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I wont go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from ones political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science.';2

'Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also lead to intolerance.  So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I dont think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Quran with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Quran cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying "For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Quran has to give all verses of the Quran equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Quran is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Quran is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Quran must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Qurans message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Lets try to understand what the Quran is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Quran based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Lets try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.';0

'[text deleted]  I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions. I havent seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you dont do things Gods way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of curse is retribution, I only meant harm or misfortune when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesnt cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is "obvious"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was "forgive them Father, they know not what they do."  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please dont give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  Its okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others dont then I would frame a response something like this:  "It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is Gods punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept Gods grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospels testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  Gods arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him."  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that havent been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to Gods commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to Gods advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,';3
'Yes.  (I am adamantly an environmentalist.  I will not use styrofoam table service. Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than Gods intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think hes going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not Gods intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is    Gods intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called "becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some."     Dont say "Forget the environment, Ive got important things to spend my time    on." - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not    creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and    glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords    woven in the infinite tapestry.';3

'{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents  is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, "Hermeneutrik und  Kritik," _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The  Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibleys extract from Blasss work is in the form of "rules for forgers."  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blasss work, only Nibleys extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example Ive heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, Im no expert on Blass work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but dont necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, "Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?"  If there are things  which dont fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.';3

In other words, if lifetime imprisonment doesnt work, perhaps   its not because were not executing these people, but because   were not being careful enough about how we lock them up.  /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.';0
'Humans have "gone somewhat beyond" what, exactly?    In one thread youre telling us that natural morality is what animals do to survive, and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient being can "definitely" say what is right and what is wrong.   So what does this omniscient being use for a criterion?   The long- term survival of the human species, or what?  How does omniscient map into "definitely" being able to assign "right" and "wrong" to actions?   Well, your "original premises" have a habit of changing over time, so perhaps youd like to review it for us, and tell us what the difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign "right" and "wrong" to actions, and telling us the result, is.    Im talking about the morality introduced by you, which was going to be implemented by this omniscient being that can "definitely" assign "right" and "wrong" to actions.  You tell us what type of morality that is.';0
'Several recent posts have identified the English word Easter with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar.  Easter is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If Easter and Ishtar were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was Eostre, cognate with English East and German Ost.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is Austron. Not until after 1400 did Easter have a high front vowel like Ishtar. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.  There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.  -- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)';3
'<...more accusations about a worldwide conspiracy against blacks.>  Since Jesus was born in the Middle East, then I expect his human features to be similar to Middle Easterners at that point in time. And since the camera wasnt invented yet we can only guess what  he looked like. For example, with all the dinosaur bones were digging up we still dont know if they were yellow-polka-dotted, or purplish-orange 8-). Likewise, I dont think anybody has a  picture of Jesus (is there ? 8-) ) So our current image of  Jesus is our best guess.  Okay. So lets assume that Jesus is black. Would that make you follow His techings ? Cause if you follow His teachings, skin  color becomes a moot point, anyway. What counts more in your life ? Your faith in Jesus or His skin color (as a human) ?  In the interest of historical accuracy, however, since Jesus was from Israel wouldnt His skin color be like any other Jew ? i.e. fair-skinned ? Although probably heavily tanned from the desert sun ? Experts in this area speak up !!! cause Im not. 8-)    --';3
'Someone writing anonymously asks:   I *did* become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and having studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser degree.  I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well. Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I dont lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasnt a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.  I am quite certain that I was not "brain-washed".';3
'The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG    which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]  	"Chances are good that if you watched 60 Minutes last November 	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In 	the segment entitled No MSG, for instance, show host Ed Bradley 	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them 	(millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently 	sick); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven 	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the 	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive  	those studies are.  	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to 	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order 	to back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that MSG, 	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as 	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT 	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on 	humans but on rabbits.  	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist 	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that 	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get  	headaches from it.  But, she explains, the show probably  	overemphasized the extent of the problem.  	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor 	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley 	remarks, says that his 20 years of research with laboratory 	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters because 	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olneys 	research with lab animals does not show anything about human 	youngsters.  	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olneys  	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected 	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing  	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly, 	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance 	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither 	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG  	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by 	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little 	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human 	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations 	found in Dr. Olneys lab animals.....  	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of 	that fact.  And so does the European Communities Scientific 	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies, 	have concluded that MSG is safe.  	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never 	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed 	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a 	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe 	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently 	exonerated the much-maligned substance.  	Thats quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of 	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever 	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one 	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken 	down into glutamate during digestion.  	Its a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the 	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes 	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in 	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.  	That doesnt mean its entirely unimaginable that a small number 	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore 	sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international 	professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus 	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large."';2
'I have an addition to the FAQ regarding "why are there no atheist hospitals."

'Lets get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation Id say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word of the form "the man you live with is not your husband" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.  Regards  David';3

'One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.  	Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.';3

'From article <Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu>, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci):  I do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person replies in an "acrid, angry and sarcastic" manner that this demonstrates their non-christianity?  The simple fact is that there is not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is perfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a sulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.  One of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become MORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT already like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I do.  Jesus was perfect.  Im not.   You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to treat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are human and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I hope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This surely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with _them_.    And dont we know it!   Again I say, we are ALL human!  To my brethren, this:    Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the warning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our Saviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set us by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :       "There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ..."  When you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your Father in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I firmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face, and in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.    I look forward to seeing you there.

'I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (cant remember the name, sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODALed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH!

'I am not aware of any "Turkish Caliphate" viewpoint on this. Can you reference?  However, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:  "Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away ones wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.   We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse mens solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones."  (Quote from Masud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam,  p. 118).  I wouldnt consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM) viewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophets cousin and the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating  night with a woman.  Selim Guncer';0

'As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isnt it found in  tomatoes?  Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something is natural doesnt mean it wont cause problems with some folks.  As for how foods taste:  If Im not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it, why shouldnt I use it?  Saying I shouldnt use it is like saying I shouldnt eat spicy food because my neighbor has an ulcer.  People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them? How should food be tasted?  Isnt it better left to the diner?';2
'just picked out this one point because it struck me.... why do you believe this?  muslims believe in many of the same things that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the messiah, is a prophet.  this seems to me to be much closer to christianity than other religions are.  (then again i tend to be somewhat liberal about others beliefs.)  this also relates to the serbian "ethnic cleansing" question.  i have been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW can we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs we condemn, if this is the case (and dont get me wrong, the things fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be tortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and killed?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he would advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them, if thats the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.    im sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a different title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.  peace (shalom), vera shanti _______________________________________________________________________________ Hand over hand				noye@midway.uchicago.edu Doesnt seem so much			(Vera Noyes) Hand over hand				 Is the strength of the common touch	drop me a line if youre in the mood 	- Rush, "Hand Over Fist" _______________________________________________________________________________  [I am also worried about this issue.  Ive made a posting under my own name earlier today.  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs here.  This isnt the right group for it.  Their beliefs about Jesus appear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible.  This means that while they honor him, what they think he did and stood for differs in many ways from Christian beliefs about him.  But Moslem beliefs are an appropriate topic for soc.religion.islam.  As Im sure you know, many Christians believe that you must accept Christ in order to be saved.

'First, I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter at hand.  All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didnt mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where Im coming from & now I know where hes coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as Ive always done.  I believe the reason that he & I "click" instead of "bash" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female.  Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The "kitchen of heaven" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of "Gods house" beginning with the images of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday & raise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where I can feel comfortable & at-home, but I dont see it happening anytime soon.';3

'A reply to a post by kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (aka Nancys Sweetheart):   ?Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted ?in very limited circumstances.  I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the "mind" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didnt say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This ?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

'I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question "What temperature does water boil at?"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told "Its just 212 degrees.  Any scale. Thats what all thermometers say."  Well, thats sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. Ive yet to meet anyone who takes the verse "blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I cant prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust Gods revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we cant comprehend the Absolutes.  So I dont need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to Gods creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  Its like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesnt affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  Im NOT claiming there is no place for authority. Thatd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --';3

'Hmmm.  The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction the first posters brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times its normal size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldnt this time, but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to, but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I dont get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I dont.    This isnt scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe its not a different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly.    I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and cant use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesnt necessarily mean that its safe for everyone.';2

I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a "deterrent" to crime. If so, why doesnt every crime carry a death penalty ? That would be effictive wouldnt it ???    The death penalty is a punishment, much like a $50 fine for speeding is a punishment. Anyway, somebody with murder on the mind doesnt much care about the consequences. I think another problem is that people dont think they will get caught. If I wanted to kill another person, I wouldnt  care what the penalty was if I didnt think I would get caught.    If it was to be strictly a deterrent, it should have been more along  the lines of torture.';0
'Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)       Sean, I dont want to get into a mini-war by what I am going to say, but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris, youll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve those for c.s.m.a :-) )     I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasnt 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (dont know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasnt even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMinds Accelerator?)?     Dont misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.     But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in  my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

'I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few years back and I cant cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watts comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in  which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God.  IMHO, Watts stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served  on the board of directors for Jim Bakkers organization, during a time in  which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker  in federal prison.';3

'One interpretation Ive heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing ones wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is Gods will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife.';3

'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer.   I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter "O" there are two outlines:  	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font) 	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a "polygon with holes". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:  	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple 		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for 		some fancy fonts). 	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I cant tell which method is the best to implement.  Thanks for any pointers.  --> Rob Lansdale';1

'Hi Janet,  Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,  same cafergot uselessness, same duration.

'I finished reading a very good book, "The Will of God", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, Gods ultimate will is never to be defeated.  Gods intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) Gods intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated Gods intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, Gods ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly ("not my will, Lord, but yours") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

'(Deletion)   Yes, sorry. I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And "given by god" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one cant becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Cant it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.';0

You see, to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is, we shall be moral unto what end?   Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think that it is a very good approximation, but we cant be perfect.   Well, "objective" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts, while "arbitary" implies no clear line of reasoning.';0

'I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally insulting.   I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long posting, and to say   	"I dont know if you are doing so, but it  	seems you are implying....."  is at the very best quite disingenuous, and perhaps even dishonest.    If anyone care to dig back and read the full posting, they will see nothing of the kind.  I trust you dont deny that Islamic teaching has "something to do" with the fatwa against Rushdie?';0

'Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--theyve considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.';0
'believeing blindly or not. Im not sure how blindness comes into it. I do > not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions > from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on > the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any > possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the > rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere > is not self explanatory).   So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since this is the only other source of information left to us). How can you then convince somebody that your "feelings and experiences" are the correct ones then if you cant show somebody visible and measurable effects?  If my experiences say that "there exists no god" and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal realities.  Furthermore, the trouble with "feelings and experiences" is that they can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I am sure that many of Koreshs followers really believed in him but I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.  Finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?   You must be using a definition of "evidence" that I am not familiar with. To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you are saying is true.  However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith. It is not something you can share around - others must experience it independantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts belief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go.   At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously,  the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it should read "for explaining the non-existence of God").  So not only must you "prove" your own case, you have to "disprove" theirs.  (alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief of their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)   I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they dont. I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes without saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct me.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the  non-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made some progress towards the truth.';3
'I lived in Tokyo for a year and a half, and one of the many reasons why I intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can walk anywhere (and I mean *anywhere*) at any time of day or night and not feel uneasy, even if ones from an ethnic minority as I was.  Clues for Bobby (why do I bother?): (i) Tokyo is a city, and inner Tokyo is an inner city; (ii) there is a negligible level of violent crime, and a street murder will be a lead item on *national* TV news; (iii) the population is almost universally atheistic.

'Hate to wreck your elaborate theory, but Steve Dyer is not an MD. So professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with Nystatin, etc., cant very well come into the picture.  Steve doesnt have any patients.     Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm when we put a tuberculin test on.  If people dont react to candida, we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not react to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida. If not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.   Youve just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory. Find something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying it is the cause of whatever.  Since no one can disprove it, you can rake in the bucks for quite some time.     That is odd, isnt it?  Why do you suppose it is that MDs with these common problems dont go for these crazy ideas?

'Hi...  Im new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  Ive debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): "We suspect thats because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  Its clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions."

'[deletions]  If this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.  Whether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or not, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words.  It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that? You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support threatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.  This is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.  You, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone, whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the "miscreants", or whatever, short of physical force.  But once you physically threaten, or support physical threats, you get much closer to your earlier comparison of rape - with YOU as the rapist who whines "She asked for it, look how she was dressed".  Blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesnt fly.  Dew';0
'Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, "better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead." (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.   It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient peoples ideas of life after death.   Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at "the turning point of time" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).   The way you refer to it as "doctrine" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different peoples ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.   Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out.';3

I had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without them. I thought that, one way or another, I would always be able to see clearly.  Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and I can no longer see close up objects clearly.  Maybe its just that my arms are getting shorter :-)';2
'The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for Gods grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldnt dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and explain what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesnt help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesnt work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend: 	Corpus Christi - W 12st St. 	Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,  	St. Josephs, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, "clean", largely gay 	Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archies help. Dont overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DECs FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word help.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRLs postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, theres BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line help message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called "The Graphics BBS".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.  [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it  out, only if you cant use FTP! -- nfotis ]  INRIA-GRAPHLIB --------------   Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail   server a few months ago.      echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and    how to browse among its files.      echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the extended summary.

Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendors lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painters Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

'Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories. Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about MSG making people ill.   Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster no doubt already knows that some people think Chinese Restaurant Syndrome is bogus.  Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo effects; people may have allergies in addition.    Have you read Olneys work? I fail to see how citing results from peer-reviewed studies qualifies as "bizarrely cracked".   Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC. Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies, for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk.   Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?  But, youre right, mice arent the best to study this on. Theyre four times less sensitive than humans to MSG.   The point is exceeding the window. Of course, theyre amino acids. Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Olneys research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount of freely available Glu in mothers milk versus commercial baby foods, vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed foods. Mothers milk was well below the effective dose.    Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.    Hmm. ".com". Why am I not surprised?';2

'So whats your point?  Marks comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is "deserved" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge "others" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So whats the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in "deviant" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate, IV-drug-free, and transfusion free.  Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --';3

'A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isnt helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isnt helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs arent supposed to be realized for several months.  As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friends doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.  My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like hes 80 (his words, not mine).   If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.

'(Dean and I write lots and lots about absolute truth and arrogance.)   I agree that well probably never agree, and Im starting to feel  frustrated, and Im tired of having my conversations with my husband  dominated by this topic (just kidding, :-)).  I do have to say, though, that participating in this discussion has been a good learning experience for me.  My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as  much as we think.   I admit that Im strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder  when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians  who didnt adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of  absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some  very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the  truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have  the answers.  Knowing the truth doesnt seem to leave a whole lot of  room for others opinions.  I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* dont try to  use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are  very careful that you dont hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor  seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes  that everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have  convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours,  based on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God.   Dont dismiss them because God didnt lead them to the same conclusions  as yours.  *This is not directed personally at you, Dean.';3

'(reference line trimmed)    Well, Id say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isnt the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by "reasonable?"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, lets look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, lets suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you dont like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isnt totally applicable to your "problem," but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested "murderer" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isnt really a problem.';0

'Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would  cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of  Christ.  Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the time they were made.  "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" refers both to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   "Why do the heathen rage" was said of David and also of Christ.    Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, "and his bishoprick let another take."

SF (and I"ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is  usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASAs  decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story  disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and  sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.   I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films, but that isnt  saying a whole lot.';2

'Subject: Re: Eugenics / ;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.  ;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will  ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding, no "hybrids", etc.  The ethical question is, should ;we?   Two past problems with eugenics have been  1) reducing the gene pool and  2) defining the status of the eugenized.   Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out "garbage genes." This may in the future become possible. Even if it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We dont really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age, meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc., etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival.    Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone elses. But if we could make "philosopher-kings" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while, it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before "1984."      I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasnt stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their turns came.   Not that I dont think that this gene altering power couldnt wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that, too.    The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally dont think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we may not. If we dont, I hope there are reservoirs of "garbage" people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded "garbage" genes which will pull us through.    I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have, and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far, or else havent had enough power for long enough.    In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isnt the power, it is the Spirit.   Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.';2

'See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it, but by your definition, it cant be shown.  And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.

'Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells.

'Id like to share my thoughts on this topic of "arrogance of Christians" and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the truth.  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, "All policemen are jerks!"  Id ask, "How do you know?"  "Because my daddy told me so!"  "How do you know youre daddy is right?"  "He says hes always right!"  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, arent we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if Im covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  --   [Im sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say theres not enough evidence to believe it, or that theres just as good evidence for other religions.  I dont agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who dont find the evidence convincing.  But that doesnt seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things thats rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but theres no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a "historical" religion.  That is, its based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the "mundane" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesnt).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope were all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I dont see how else we could proceed.  This neednt result in arrogance.  Im certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they dont, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But its got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.';3
': When the object of their belief is said to be perfect and make the believers : act in a certain way and we observe that they dont, we have a contradiction. : Something defined contradictorily cannot exist.

Secondly, there are better explanations for why they believe than : the existence of the object of their belief. :   :   : Have you read the FAQ already? :    Benedikt  Benedikt,  I cant recall anyone claiming that God -makes- anyone act a particlar way, I think that youre attempting to manufacture a contradiction.

A standard of conduct does exist, but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient, but our response to Gods edicts can in no way be used to question Gods existence. The behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of Gods existence; there is nothing contradictory here.  To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).  Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rats nest of unnecessary complexity. I think I know what youre implying, but Id like to see your version of this better alternative just the same.';0

'In soc.religion.christian you write:   Note that the above type of prediction does not require a God to be made. An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience. Beware of predictions like "The volcano will erupt tomorrow!"  Dont follow the preacher because of such statements that come true.  Note also, that if Im describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say "his mother predicted he would die."  Of course, his father may have said "he ll make good money because of his hobby" and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one thats relevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, "Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that theyd have a state again, and that the time has come.  (Ive read this somewhere, but cant think of the source - if you can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state.

'Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve? 	Im new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the persons childhood taken into account? 	Im sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that youre the experts.  						-Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect thats because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement."  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldnt possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, its easy to see why youd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far Gods cheating extends.  Will he accept people who dont explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but its not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how hes going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we cant expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.';3

'Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising.  One aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking process.   Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world. It is objective.   Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example, since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which affects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the physical world.   The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this cannot be said of scientists.';3

'J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the "Plymouth Brethren" and an early supporter of dispensationalism.  F.F. Bruce highly approved of his translation.  He also translated the Bible into several other languages.   This was from the same fellow who did Youngs Concordance, which was a standard reference work, similar to Strongs concordance.   I believe that these just follow standard reference works.   Some are by Larry Pierce ("Brethren"), some are by Baptists, and I think that Thompson (of chain reference fame) was Presbyterian)   Another standard reference work that has been around for decades. A new version was just released and is available through Christian Book Distributers.   C.I. Scofield was the creator of the Scofield Reference Bible.  For many people (but not me), this is THE STUDY BIBLE.  The notes are strongly dispensational.   These are probably the most accurate Strongs numbers available.';3
'The ONLY unity Ive found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, Ive found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from "Christians".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  Ive also been a part of some "Christian" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didnt care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  Creeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?   According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states:      In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have Gods approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities:    devotion to the apostles teaching    fellowship    communion    filling with awe for God    all having everything in common.    glad and sincere hearts    praising God    enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, "a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).     One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one Ive found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one Ive seen which is totally sold out to God.  As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the "true one", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, Ive heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that theyve ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I havent.  I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something "correct" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being "opened up" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he wouldve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  Theres enough division without.';3
'Now this is getting interesting!  I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the resurrection in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the "great judgement" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my "soul" (which, by the way, I dont believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people "sleep" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that Im omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different "technology" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I dont think most people claim to know the details.  I dont think Id say its the same atoms.  Id assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldnt expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  Id suspect that its in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.';3

'Some thoughts:  [A. On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone elses.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didnt tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But its not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) Its hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time. Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available to the general public.

'At the end of a recent (Mon 19 Apr 1993) post, Alastair Thomson offers the following "paraphrase" of John 3:16:     "God loved the world so much, that he gave us His Son,    to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life."

I told her that I tried to find out if there were  any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldnt tell me.  About her marraige comment (Im not gonna call it a proposal, cause I still dont know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said that "Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then well talk :) :)"  Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.  Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I  have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldnt do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian. It just wouldnt work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure that if God wanrs this to go through--hes kept us in touch for 10  years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it will happen!  She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so Ill get to  see her...and Ill get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to.

'My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably enough, along with the usual good diet.

'I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that ones relationship with God is superior to others, that leads to arrogance.

'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.  	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively 	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume 	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not 	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable 	measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment 	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two 	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw 	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is 	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge 	colored with a special "edge color"  	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.';1

'Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeinis ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Quran, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of "fasad". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of "fasad" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the "crisis". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on "fasad" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.';0

'There are a lot of people running around saying "God told me this" and  "God told me that" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He said someone told him, "The Lord gave me a song."  He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard.  "I know why he gave you that song," Murillo said, "He didnt want it anymore."  But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.    Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an "M" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, "He never prophesies anything good about me."  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his  lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an  apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.    So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it  Scripture.     I dont know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with  prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also  similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, "And his bishoprick let another take" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.    Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.   Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a  bit hazy.  Imho, it doesnt usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the  Spirit, and use them according to His leading.';3

'AH! But what, exactly, is "inherently abhorrent" and WHY is it so? What youre saying is, in effect, "I think some things are repulsive, and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me, so they should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period".        Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with you. But I do _not_ agree that things are inherently or absolutely immoral; they are labeled immoral each for its own good reason, and if the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.  [...]        No it doesnt. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another story altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence to moral absolutism (of a flavour).  [...]        Youre saying morality is whatll keep society alive and kicking. It is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and neither are their moralities.         Similar != identical.

'I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System (sort of a justice of the peace).  I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didnt realize that marriage is Gods institution, not the states.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and "marriage" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.          I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issues logical extension: If intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?';3

So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.

'I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be  learned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesnt mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone elses.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just dont believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isnt at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think weve established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter  of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still  claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  Whats the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldnt) act upon them?  What practical  difference can this make?';3

The problem: Im writing an application for the PC that may have at most 256 colors. I want to use one colormap (palette) for the application but Id like it to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum. I could use  a 6x6x6 RGB cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost identical to the human eye.';1

'Yes, I do.      My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is its primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasnt clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?    Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond   that I dont belief the state should have the right to take life   at all.

'I dont meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but Id like to point out a few things.   "no meaning from God" is not the same as "no meaning". From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just "give" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)    This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.   Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isnt so bad?   As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose, and create.   Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever with anyone.  (I dont think you will either, but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter.)   I tend to agree with you.  Its my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal parts of human societies.  I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that havent proved lethal to humanity yet.   I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know who first came up with the "God-shaped hole" business?   You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim like this.   I dont know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.  --- 			- Dan Johnson And God said "Jeeze, this is dull"... and it *WAS* dull.

'Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).    OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .  						kind regards,';2

'[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]   First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to "seek and save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in Gods eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples "will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the "fiery lake of burning sulfur". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast "will be tormented with burning sulfur" and there being "no rest day or night" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  "The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God."  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following Im mostly playing "devils advocate".  Im not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that its possible to see these passages in different ways.  Its possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term "second death".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that theres a wide enough variety of images that its possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned dont get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes Im aware that its possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isnt eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesnt mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as "the second death". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is "everlasting destruction"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think its at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesnt explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesnt say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I dont see that it says anything relevant to this issue.';3

'Archive-name: atheism/overview Alt-atheism-archive-name: overview Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2                                     Overview  Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a controversial nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet" and "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.  If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "Finding Stuff" section below.                                      Credits  These files could not have been written without the assistance of the many readers of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you cant find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you dont find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isnt set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and youll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you dont have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    Theres other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and    "send atheism/index".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if youve tried the above methods and theyve failed; its not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or peoples mailboxes with requests for files.    its better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who dont have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.';0
'I totally agree with that sentiment.  But why do you have to go further and advocate violating what God has set up?  That is the question which you have not answered from Scripture.  You can worship on every day, as long as you work.  But God says the Sabbath is all mine.';3
'First, off Id say that the impact if right before your eyes! 8-) That we are even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Dont forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didnt  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didnt know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, Im not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, Im talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasnt buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

'Greetings,     I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 7570 or 7574 - Im not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16 packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black, 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.      The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).      I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you wont need to purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to function as well.      Id be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them.      Im selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I dont need color.      Id like $350 or best offer...      -Chert';1

'I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last weeks _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christis pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted "...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy."  I note that at my  parents parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because its moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?';3
'(Deletion) (Deletion)   An universe it has created. By the way, can you tell me why it is less tyrannic to let one of ones own creatures do what it likes to others? By your definitions, your god has created Satan with full knowledge what would happen - including every choice of Satan.   Can you explain us what Free Will is, and how it goes along with omniscience? Didnt your god know everything that would happen even before it created the world? Why is it concerned about being a tyrant when noone would care if everything was fine for them? That the whole idea comes from the possibility to abuse power, something your god introduced according to your description?';0
'One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I dont have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of "I will be in you and you will be in me."  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didnt recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasnt like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I dont expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.  Peace, Will.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------';3
'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Joe, just cause you say they arent subject to interpretation doesnt necesarily make it so.  Thats *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of ones own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly its not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, theres probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think its naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are  an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time  and energy on it.';3

'Peir-Yuan Yeh asks:  same >or part of them are the same?  How about Torah? Are the first five books >of OT as the same as Torah?????  Yes, yes, and yes.  Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and as shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.  The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings) and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).  And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.  Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called "the mighty God."  And if he was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead, your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.';3
'[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word "on faith", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesnt require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I dont believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.';0

'I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?) Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them.';3

'I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation. Thats because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, "Cogito, ergo sum," yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable.';3

'This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, Ive posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read alt.psychology.personality and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that scare away many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the pressure by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, theres nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:          Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from ones internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change peoples personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  Im sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.';3

'Library of Congress to Host Dead Sea Scroll Symposium April 21-22  To: National and Assignment desks, Daybook Editor  Contact: John Sullivan, 202-707-9216, or Lucy Suddreth, 202-707-9191           both of the Library of Congress     WASHINGTON, April 19  -- A symposium on the Dead Sea  Scrolls will be held at the Library of Congress on Wednesday, April 21, and Thursday, April 22.  The two-day program, cosponsored by the library and Baltimore Hebrew University, with additional support from the Project Judaica Foundation, will be held in the librarys Mumford Room, sixth floor, Madison Building.    Seating is limited, and admission to any session of the symposium must be requested in writing (see Note A).    The symposium will be held one week before the public opening of a major exhibition, "Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Scholarship," that opens at the Library of Congress on April 29.  On view will be fragmentary scrolls and archaeological artifacts excavated at Qumran, on loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority.  Approximately 50 items from Library of Congress special collections will augment these materials.  The exhibition, on view in the Madison Gallery, through Aug. 1, is made possible by a generous gift from the Project Judaica Foundation of Washington, D.C.    The Dead Sea Scrolls have been the focus of public and scholarly interest since 1947, when they were discovered in the desert 13 miles east of Jerusalem.  The symposium will explore the origin and meaning of the scrolls and current scholarship.  Scholars from diverse academic backgrounds and religious affiliations, will offer their disparate views, ensuring a lively discussion.    The symposium schedule includes opening remarks on April 21, at 2 p.m., by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, and by Dr. Norma Furst, president, Baltimore Hebrew University.  Co-chairing the symposium are Joseph Baumgarten, professor of Rabbinic Literature and Institutions, Baltimore Hebrew University and Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, Library of Congress.    Geza Vermes, professor emeritus of Jewish studies, Oxford University, will give the keynote address on the current state of scroll research, focusing on where we stand today. On the second day, the closing address will be given by Shmaryahu Talmon, who will propose a research agenda, picking up the theme of how the Qumran studies might proceed.    On Wednesday, April 21, other speakers will include:     -- Eugene Ulrich, professor of Hebrew Scriptures, University of Notre Dame and chief editor, Biblical Scrolls from Qumran, on "The Bible at Qumran;"    -- Michael Stone, National Endowment for the Humanities distinguished visiting professor of religious studies, University of Richmond, on "The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha."    -- From 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. a special preview of the exhibition will be given to symposium participants and guests.     On Thursday, April 22, beginning at 9 a.m., speakers will include:     -- Magen Broshi, curator, shrine of the Book, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, on "Qumran: The Archaeological Evidence;"    -- P. Kyle McCarter, Albright professor of Biblical and ancient near Eastern studies, The Johns Hopkins University, on "The Copper Scroll;"    -- Lawrence H. Schiffman, professor of Hebrew and Judaic studies, New York University, on "The Dead Sea Scrolls and the History of Judaism;" and    -- James VanderKam, professor of theology, University of Notre Dame, on "Messianism in the Scrolls and in Early Christianity."     The Thursday afternoon sessions, at 1:30 p.m., include:     -- Devorah Dimant, associate professor of Bible and Ancient Jewish Thought, University of Haifa, on "Qumran Manuscripts: Library of a Jewish Community;"    -- Norman Golb, Rosenberger professor of Jewish history and civilization, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, on "The Current Status of the Jerusalem Origin of the Scrolls;"    -- Shmaryahu Talmon, J.L. Magnas professor emeritus of Biblical studies, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, on "The Essential Commune of the Renewed Covenant: How Should Qumran Studies Proceed?" will close the symposium.     There will be ample time for question and answer periods at the end of each session.     Also on Wednesday, April 21, at 11 a.m.:    The Library of Congress and The Israel Antiquities Authority will hold a lecture by Esther Boyd-Alkalay, consulting conservator, Israel Antiquities Authority, on "Preserving the Dead Sea Scrolls" in the Mumford Room, LM-649, James Madison Memorial Building, The Library of Congress, 101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, D.C.     ------    NOTE A: For more information about admission to the symposium, please contact, in writing, Dr. Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, African and Middle Eastern Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540.  -30-';3

'A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100 bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule.  The Phillips rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the commercial release date.  By the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of 3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip sets will be in full production.  The number of software companies designing titles for the box will be over 300.  How do I know this?  I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters last week.

'I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why dont we get some dialog going here?  Heres a topic to get things started. My daughters Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is drawing near. Look up!';3

'Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.';1
'Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.    Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasnt been in use that long, and it really isnt clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, id say no.  euclid';2

'Andrew,     How I wish this were true, and how I long for the day in which it will be true.  But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, "His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I dont think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian it to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.';3

'Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But heres a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called "PEX".  PEXlib is a slightly "lower" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of "policy" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If youre working strictly in X and dont care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both APIs have a lot in common.';1

'Two thoughts.  	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next  generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown upon messing with Nature, ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that. Any new human intervention is arrogance and hubris and manipulation we routinely do is natural and certainly not a big deal.  	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them wont be the advantage its made out to be.

'As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.  But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science.  There are a couple of negative points to make here:  1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.  (I wouldnt hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I dont think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.)  2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results dont count unless they can be replicated.  The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.  Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteurs irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result.  This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists).';2
'Sometimes I have a problem with doctors prescribing medicine like this.  I of course dont know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isnt helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this is what it is, shell probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what Ive read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I havent changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really "kicks in").  Also, it doesnt necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I dont take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.

He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEGs show alot of seizure activity.

'I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though "accepted", may not be necessary for the patient at the time.

'seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) asks:  > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?          The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is "what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?"  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to "celebrating" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of "Ressurection Sunday" I think.  (Though Im not too crazy about the word "Sunday", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical methods?    > I dont recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate  > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that  > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?         So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.

What happened to "there is  > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for  > all are one in Christ Jesus"?         Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemons "slave" returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different "rules" that apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more "male and female" can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.   ---------------------------------------  [I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.  Id like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to "first day", "second day", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed Id like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christs resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in peoples minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  Its not clear that this is a healthy thing.';3

'This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.  In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no "gift of scripture".  And I dont know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.  If you dont give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case, theyll have a better handle on it the next time.  Didnt you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes. Spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.   The canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer speaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.';3
'This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique Id never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (Ive smoking a duck right now, as it happens), Ive noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason Ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  Im pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, dont know about the others.';2

'I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you, although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup.  I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical substance of mans being and nature.  A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahharis "Fundamentals of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe" - Mizan Press, translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book (if you can find a decent translation) is "Wilaya - The Station of the Master" by the same author. I think it also goes under the title of "Master and Mastership" - Its a very small book - really just a transcription of a lecture by the author. The introduction to the beautiful "Psalms of Islam" - translated by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We have these books in our University library - I imagine any well stocked University library will have them.  From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You should seek to know Shiite thought through knowledgeable  Shiite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled.';0
'Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting: "The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_ believer and who may be "faking it".  This is something known only by the person him/herself (and God).  Your assumption that anyone who _claims_ to be a "believer" _is_ a "believer" is not necessarily true."  In other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and false Muslim. We are back to square one, Khomeini and Hussein are  still innocent and cant be defined as evil or good Islamic  worshippers.  Cheers, Kent';0
'Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe theyre going to hell. They believe theyre going to _die_. Understand that youve turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are going to Hell. Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals dont have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesnt change the fact that theyre going to Hell (die a final death))     I dont claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I go to Hell and not to Heaven) In other words, Ill never know Im dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  "At least shes not suffering any more; Shes in Heaven now." ?      Consider the following statement:  "At least shes not suffering any more; Shes in Hell now."      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldnt be *anything* (wouldnt be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda ("Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?" Its my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  "Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, "Well what good is your Heaven if theres no hunting? Scram." I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).         Pax,';3
': There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread : that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.  This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However, I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations.   It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual, for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science. However, science has one advantage theology doesnt: it is self- correcting, with nature as its judge.   It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self- consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer a bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to psychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe from its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.   There is no need : for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by : physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is : determnined.  Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question, and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have any meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent free will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their perspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not?   : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence, its just a happy accident.  Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of  numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same principle - only the systems that can start replicating will survive, those which dont dont make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)  : For an atheist, no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- : an event can have value.   From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from my perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have a perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective perspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if I think about what it would it be like in their position, I will eventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution. Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity, too.   Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.) for starters.  : How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It : seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what : in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to : establish your values.  C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is severely flawed.  Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some others, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools, they also became better at killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against ones own people.  The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people together, under one god. Their god did not care much about people of other nations.   At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along with it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)  : Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what : difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or : otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only : way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesnt like it : - thats it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any "absolute" sense.  It looks like you havent bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there is an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may  value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result of some physical event), and others happiness, too, if the observer comes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is, without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their meaning.   It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_  personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths do not exist.   The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence.  Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and many other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed.   : That you dont like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or Gods commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your : objections -seem- well founded is due to the way youve been : conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.  The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism is still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.  You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective point of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view, _which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being, has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not cease to be subjective.   From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither does pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are  inherently subjective.   Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if we dont, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god gave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my fault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with ones own and then to get mad at this.   God must be schizophrenic.  : All of this being so, you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, : etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever.  Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.  Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being, _including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his own point of view, and his morals are his own.   Petri';0

'The "so sacred its secret" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peters response is "You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I dont intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given" (Matt. 13:11).  2. "All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given" (Matt. 19:11).  3. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now" (John 16:12).  4. "The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father" (John 16:25).  5. "... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. "Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu';3
'Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which are connected by at least one edge.  If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.

'I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout back in the 1960s. The issue wasnt gays, but the principles were the same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesnt belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts havent given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.  On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.';0

'I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had             them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of             Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been             counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesuss name. ACT 5:28    "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said.             "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are             determined to make us guilty of this mans blood."  Finally, the first apostles death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Romes hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.     The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.';3

'As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the "innovations" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.  I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just instituted the "Tenebrae" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for  a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those "facts" were always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over breakfast Easter Sunday.  My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committees suggestions.  It needs a strong hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA "wishy-washy".   As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir- regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth. The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by everyone.  I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I dont want  them attending a show.  Its not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is Not there.  Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and "fit in". My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who have beared with me this far understand what I mean.  Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldnt listen.  They are there to  provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with the Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and ministers.

'This is a good point, but I think "average" people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesnt hurt anybody...    These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but lets make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like "...let him be, as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace." or something like that.  (Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY "at peace", there would be no need for inflicting evangelism)   Well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School, I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since Ive been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.

'To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.     This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis "A is not not-A". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word "believe", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. "I believe Tom went to  the library." (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. "I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws." (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each others words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.';3
'The argument for Lukes genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Marys genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husbands, from Davids son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from Davids son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesuss physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesuss messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesuss divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Josephs seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not "known"each other).  Thus the first gospels dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of "how this could be" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiners "The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity", "The Gospel of St. Luke", and "The Gospel of St. Matthew".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiners methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of ones Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Marys Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.';3

'Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburgs work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isnt broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.';3

'All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Pauls letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point Im making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Pauls letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDAs accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  Thats why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.';3

'One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Mans Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.  It doesnt "compare" religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way.';0
'This is not true.  The athiests position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the "proof", this does not  satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question "Does God exist?" i.e. self-awareness and reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?  You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since we can only use faith, why is one picture of "God" (e.g. Hinduism) any less valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?';3

'Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man  This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the "Elevator of the heavens."  This "god" made men able to "feel" as if heaven were afar off and "as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws."  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled "Emancipator" or "Deliverer"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of Gods wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.   I dont see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming "Anointed One" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Roms makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.   I understand what youre trying to convey, but I dont think Id lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness.     It depends upon your def of "lost."  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.  Existentially we were all born "lost", but the "righteous" were "in Christ" and therefore never *assuredly* lost.    Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply have to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive.  Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum.   Couldnt agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is clearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring to.    No, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.   Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I think, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it.  Look at Satans twist of Gods Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very interesting study.   >The similarity in the midst of great variety of  Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as "mystery" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The "Mystery of Iniquity" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the "husband son.")   No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what youre alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinsons "Egyptians."  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they "pilfered" from the Egyptians.    Im not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that "there is nothing new under the sun."';3

'Here is another way of looking at it.  When we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the  resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls.

'Well, Ive provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  I dont think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  Ill have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I dont claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isnt harmful, although it isnt helpful either (to the mating process).

'Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside, outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.';1
'I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style "values-free" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make "choices", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in "contraceptive technology" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why dont we teach "safe drug use" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isnt it because we know that a class in "how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs" would increase drug use?  Why isnt "drug abstinence education" barred from schools because it teaches "religion"?  Arent we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?';3

INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I wont even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  Its not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if youre really just here to learn.  Its more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when its dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded by God, he knows our limitations.    Interesting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base.  If I were to be imprisoned in the limited ego/mind I am in now I doubt I would choose imortality.  It would get awfully boring.    TWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS/INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION 1. What is the nature of eternal life? 2. How can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it?';3

'I must have missed the postings about Waco, David Koresh, and the Second Coming.  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  Im not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didnt.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christs day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didnt accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, Look, here is the Christ!  or Look, there he is! do not believe it.  Mark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and  wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.  Mark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand.  Mark 13:24    "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be  darkened, and the moon will not give its light,  Mark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in  the heavens will be shaken.  Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with  great power and glory.   My understanding of Jesus answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  Hes telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.  By the way, from Koreshs public statement its not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.';3
'Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:   (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize precisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that its a compressed format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header.   (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF?

I dont find it hard to believe that "Ole Zlumber" really believes the hate and ignorant prattle he writes. The frightening thought is, there are people even worse than he! To say that feminism equals "superiority" over men is laughable as long as he doesnt then proceed to pick up a rifle and start to shoot women as a preemptive strike--- aka the Canada slaughter that occured a few years ago. But then, men killing women is nothing new. Islamic Fundamentalists just have a "better" excuse (Quran).       from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990     by John Davidson, Canadian Press       MONTREAL-- Perhaps its the letter to the five-year old     daughter that shocks the most.       "I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what     happened to your parents," wrote Patrick Prevost. "I loved     your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred."       Police found the piece of paper near Prevosts body in his     apartment in northeast Montreal.       They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic "battles."       Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited]   Then to say that women are somehow "better" or "should" be the one to "stay home" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often  more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH should stay home to do so!';0
'My wifes ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  When the doctor couldnt hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)  On her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!  My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.  Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a  radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find such an expert in Chicago?)  We dont really have any special medical reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob-gyn cant, then I dont see why we shouldnt use one.  Any thoughts?';2

'No one else seems to know, so Ill post this.  This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  Ive never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victims body fluids would literally be "heavy".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victims weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victims urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?  Paul.';2

'You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  Im not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Popes position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   dont jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that "Im NOT wrong, I CANT be wrong, and theres NO WAY Ill change my mind, YOU must change yours", that Ive either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and dont paly what appear to be semantic games like "Hes the Pope, but we dont recognize that what he does is effective...".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, Im not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, Im not trying to be contentions, Im trying to understand. Since Im Orthodox, Ive got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Popes commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I dont know if thats even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman  trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant  Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University  Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in  transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is  a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and  always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a  very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our  hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence  will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be  cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome  Dr. Teperman.             WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE   LAST MEETING  It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of  TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being  able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.   No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored  again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island  Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many  braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good  conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan,  a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not  able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to  discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman,  an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient  was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman  gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,  (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to  minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine  and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank  her for an entertaining evening.    ANNUAL MEETING  In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is  also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official  notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main  purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit  member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and  to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two  year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following  slate for the Board.           Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)  Those remaining on the Board for another year are:           Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)  This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work  and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have  backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition  to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also  be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board  members and there is plenty of work.   In addition,  brief treasurers and membership reports will be  given and the floor will be open for any new business,  suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.  We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the  majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.  FUTURE MEETINGS  Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.         May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center       June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                    Brook Kidney Transplant Program.   Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.  NOTDAW  The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor  Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases,  speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and  Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game    because of two years experience with miserable weather.   We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We  have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish  a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to  address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of  life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample  letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.  DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED   The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will  hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the  Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas  Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and  are going fast.  If youd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne  Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.  MEMBERSHIP NEWS   Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant  in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing  well after only 12 days in hospital.  Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston  Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation  works!  We hope the national press notices.        Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his  transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis  and feeling better.    Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie,  spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems  encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.   They are back in New York where Nicoles treatment will  continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery.   Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall  that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a  candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNCs special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesnt work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally cant go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently dont like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I wont tell you all the things Ive tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently dont encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.';2

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DONT WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealands Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and Rehabilitation: A Practitioners Guide".  First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldnt have your hands): (note: youre likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)    RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries   OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI   CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI   WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI   CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)   Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.   Pronation: Turning the palm down.   Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.   Supination: Turning the palm up.   Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.   Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.   Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.   Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.   Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.   Abduction: Moving away from the body.   Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.  Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse conditions.  Local problems are what youd expect: specific muscles, tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although theyre not necessarily "the problem."  --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Heres the theory.  Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow.  By the time youre exerting 50% of your full power, youre completely restricting your blood flow.  Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.  Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues.  Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too.  Anyway, when youre typing too much, youre never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse.  --- Specific injuries you may have heard of:  (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)  Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and youve got your problem.  Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.  Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as neural tension, this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS  disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).  Others: for just about every part of your body, theres a fancy name for a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).  ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment  The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If youre under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every three minutes.  Its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax.  If you cant sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal.  There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say whats best for you.  --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that Im lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach]  . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - dont flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Dont slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.  Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There  should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much.  Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest.  Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area.  If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.  [Now, I diverge a little from the text]  A good chair makes a big difference.  If you dont like your chair, go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one thats right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  The name says it all.  --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:  There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you shouldnt be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  Its often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands.  Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.  ==5== Requests for more info  Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive is incomplete.  Theres always more information out there.  If youd like to submit something, please send me mail, and Ill gladly throw it in.  If youd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be wonderful!  Id love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  Id love somebody to make a list of doctors.  Id love somebody to edit the above sections, looking for places where Ive obviously goofed.  ==6== References  I completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service, a service of their Department of Labour.
